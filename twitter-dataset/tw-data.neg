Corbyn no plan for Brexit. Wouldn't answer questions. Can't say he'd defend our country. Denying his past.
Clear win for PM. Clear plan for Brexit. Not afraid to tackle difficult issues and answer the questions.
Corbyn won't admit IRA were terrorists. Won't admit they killed a lot of people
Very very very clear - Corbyn will never protect us against our enemies.
Corbyn asked how he would respond to UK being threatened by nuclear attack. No answer that made any sense - Clearly he would do nothing
Corbyn thinks last Labour government that wrecked the economy and wrote letter saying all money gone didn't spend enough!
Small business face tax rises under Labour. Corbyn will hike taxes to highest level since WW2. We are supporting business and cutting tax
Corbyn sneered at a man who runs a small business when he said he has 5 employees. Backbone of the country you Marxist! Shame on you.
Corbyn asked is he would rule out and SNP coalition. Waffle waffle blah blah. Of course he would and that would damage Brexit opportunities
Corbyn first question an easy one - what will he do on Brexit.Doesn't mention immigration. That's because he knows it will go up with Labour
PM not ducking Qs on tough decisions. We can only look after the country with a strong economy + good Brexit deal. Only Theresa can deliver
This is a PM for the whole country. No matter if you voted Leave or Remain she will get best deal for whole U.K + seize great opportunities
I have seen PM in cabinet and in global negotiations. She is strong + fights hard for UK. Corbyn has never fought for Britain and never will
PM doesn't duck hard decisions. She wants a great Brexit future full of optimism. Only Theresa can go and fight for Britain
Campaigning in London today. People very worried about Labour's Garden Tax + Inheritance Tax plans. Tories the ones delivering lower taxes
Just asked Thornberry how Labour will cut immigration. Erm ahhh umm eeeee ermm. No plan!
Emily Thornberry just said there's no Garden Tax in Labour's manifesto. Lie - search for value land tax and it's there. It will clobber you!
Thornberry just said in our Sun debate Labour would keep us in EU. If you don't leave single market + customs union you don't leave the EU.
Theresa May stands up for all and stands against intolerance. We are proud of Jewish communities - Labour very poorâ€_ <LINK/>
Again, Corbyn didn't mention the most important issue for our future - Brexit <HASHTAG/> sendforhisipad <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber is spot on - Theresa will deliver for UK. She's the only leader who will get best Brexit deal <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Come on Jezza, you talk about leadership but yet again you don't mention Brexit <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Here's leadership: imagine Corbyn in charge where 2/3 of his MPs don't support him <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber lays out the facts â€“ crime is down by a third <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The risks of Corbyn becoming PM, in charge of our Brexit negotiations and our security, are enormous <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Again, the only way we can invest in our public services and our NHS is by having a strong economy <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
And Jezza's <HASHTAG/> magicmoneytree is back out again <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The only way we can invest in our public services is by building a strong economy â€“ and the key to that is getting Brexit right <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
There you have it folks - a horrifying glimpse into the shambolic coalition of chaos that would put Jeremy Corbyn into No.10 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
For those watching <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate that is what a <HASHTAG/> coalitionofchaos looks like: no clear plan, squabbling, taxes whacked up + no Brexit deal
Come on Jezza - answer the question <LINK/>
There you go folks - Jezza can't say he would control immigration <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Leaving the EU means we can control and reduce immigration. Leaked document today showed Corbyn would scrap immigration controls <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn needs to check his ipad again - he thinks the deficit's up; it's down 2/3 of GDP. Can you imagine him negotiating Brexit? <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The IFS say Corbynâ€™s tax hikes would cost jobs and investment <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
As Amber says we have done hard work in govt to deliver more jobs - 2.9m since 2010 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn still hasn't mentioned Brexit - only Theresa May can get the best deal for this country <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Farron would join forces in a coaltion of chaos to whack up your taxes - from inheritance, income and introduce a garden tax <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn said today he would talk to the SNP the day after the election <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Took Corbyn less than 60 seconds to talk about higher taxes - no mention of Brexit <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
Amber spot on - the choice is Corbyn and a coalition of chaos or Theresa May making a successful Brexit <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
Great chat with the hardworking and decent people of Uxbridge + South Ruislip. I hope I can proudly serve you againâ€_ <LINK/>

PM "It is a q of what is going to be the right deal for us: to give us control of our money, our borders  &  our laws" <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Only the PM can deliver on Brexit and get the best deal for the UK <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
We need to be strong  &  united to get the best from Brexit - the other parties want to mess up Brexit, risking our future <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
The PM respects the will of the British people and will make a success of Brexit <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Only the PM can get the best Brexit deal <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jezza was dodging questions  &  denying his past. We need a PM whoâ€™ll stand up  &  make the tough decisions - thatâ€™s Theresa <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
As the PM says, she has a plan and only she can get the best possible deal in the Brexit discussions <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jezza was dodging questions all over the place. PM has been answering it straight <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Strong, clear and honest answer on social care from the PM - donâ€™t listen to Corbynâ€™s scare campaign <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Strong opener from the PM <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
We have protected police budget and Corbynâ€™s team wanted to cut it by 10% <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
You saw it at first hand folks. Corbyn hasn't got the guts + courage to take the tough decisions and keep us safe <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn wonâ€™t strike against ISIS attack planning! Canâ€™t have this weak jelly as PM <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Again Corbyn is dodging answering the question and can't answer if he will reduce immigration <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Paxo is right - when the Brexit talks begin the EU leaders will have Jezza for breakfast <HASHTAG/> battlefornumber10
More porkies from the Corbinator - first said he wrote the manifesto, now heâ€™s saying he didn't <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Slippery Jezza dodging the question again - he doesnâ€™t believe in renewing Trident and would risk our national security <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Don't trust Corbyn when it comes to defence and he dodged the questions on Trident <HASHTAG/> battlefornumber10
Jezza says this is about rejigging the economy - yeah right. Him in power = higher taxes, fewer jobs, more debt <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jezza talks about leadership. Here's his leadership for you: 2 / 3 of his MPs dont back him <HASHTAG/> battlefornumber10
Folks - remember what Corbyn said in 2011: Iâ€™ve been involved in opposing anti-terror legislation ever since...1983â€™ <HASHTAG/> battlefornumber10

11 days after the election the EU wants to start Brexit negotiations - itâ€™ll be <NAME/> or <NAME/> Onlyâ€_ <LINK/>
PM <NAME/> gets it spot on - thereâ€™s a Â£58 billion black hole in Corbynâ€™s manifesto that youâ€™ll pay for with higher taxes and more debt
Strong and clear from the Prime Minister <NAME/> on social care - so older people don't have to worry about cost of care <NAME/>

Corbyn 'I have not supported any of those organisations' - just stood on a platform with them and called them 'friends'
Corbyn won't commit to EVER using nuclear weapons. That means deterrent is dead if he becomes PM
Corbyn avoiding question to what he would do if under threat of nuclear attack. Because he doesn't know
Lab manifesto 'serious and realistic'? Surely not with Â£30 bn black hole according to IFS
Rising corp tax will cripple small businesses - the way to fund the NHS is to help businesses like this gentleman's expand not hobble them
'No deal better than a bad deal' - the biggest Brexit dividing line. Has Jeremy Corbyn ever negotiated anything?
In education and health it isn't just how much money surely it's about spending it better = a fair funding formula only this PM willing 2 do
Surely Theresa May gets to heart of issue on mental health when she says it is all about early intervention
Who is the PM who has done more 4 mental health than any other? Theresa May. Â£1.4 bn more this yr vs 3 years ago, 120,000 more treated ev yr
11,000 more docs and 12,000 more nurses compared to 2010 - not possible without public sector pay restraint
Â£3.9 bn more on NHS and social care being spent this year than Lab promised in 2015
45,000 had to sell their houses to pay for care under Labour - only this PM willing to tackle this unfairness
We do NOT have cap now - Dilnot proposals would have meant funding it through taxation on younger people so we will have fairer solution
Who else has been honest abt problems in social care and come up with a solution? W.s have been easy 2 duck but Theresa May tackling head on
The kind of weak Jeremy Corbyn performance tonight that he would show when negotiating on Brexit and managing coalition of chaos <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
A coalition of chaos with each boasting about putting up people's taxes and undermining people's decision on Brexit. <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
He talks about leadership taking advice but Jeremy Corbyn ignores the 172 of his own MPs who begged him to resign <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Amber Rudd a class apart. Only one with serious substantial answers. We can't leave Brexit in hands of others in this shambles <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Jeremy Corbyn has opposed every piece of anti-terrorism legislation for a generation. He cannot hide from this shameful record. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The coalition of chaos congratulating each other for sharing regressive and uncosted policies <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Critical pt from Amber. We r spending half a trillion Â£Â£ on the NHS over 5 years but all at risk from Labour's fantasy economics <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
A vote for anyone but Theresa May puts Corbyn in power, propped up by the chaotic squabbling of Nicola Sturgeon and Tim Farron.<HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn muddling the debt and deficit again. The kind of forgetfulness and fantasy economics that destroys jobs and incomes. <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Cutting taxes on business helped create 2.9 million jobs, and has increased tax receipts. That's how to fund our public services <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Choices even clearer - tax rises from the SNP, Lib Dems and Labour, whom the IFS are clear would need to hit ordinary families <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
A successful Brexit and a strong economy, or a coalition of chaos from the rest. A clear choice set out by Amber Rudd. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
TM v clear why we cannot continue to duck long term challenge of social care funding, and how our proprosals are fairer <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Theresa May very clear how she will face up to huge challenges and choices we face, including on health and social care <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
The PM clear on how we are providing record funding to our NHS. Only Labour can explain why they cut NHS budget in Wales <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Record education funding enabled by a strong economy, can only be protected if we back Theresa May to see Brexit through <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Reassuring, clear response from PM on why we have to ensure a sustainable social care system, confronting the challenge <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Again Corbyn attempting to distance himself from his own publicly stated views, now saying his own manifesto isn't really his <HASHTAG/> battleforNo10
Corbyn says he wants a deal with EU at any cost, but the price would be paid by families and business across our country <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Destroying businesses, jobs and incomes with higher taxes does nothing to help funding for vital services like our NHS <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Having refused seven times to say he would definitely leave the EU, Corbyn is unfit to negotiate a good deal for Britain <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn's weak responses on leadership Qs show just why three-quarters of his own MPs donâ€™t support him <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10

Nothing more insincere than Labour promising hardworking NHS staff a pay rise with money they've already promised to students and schools.
With 27 countries lined up against us when negotiations start, Labour simply can't match Theresa May's strong leadership.
Getting the best Brexit deal vital to be able to fund NHS on the back of a strong economy - can't be said often enough <NAME/> !

Tim Farron spent the evening arguing with his would-be coalition of chaos partners, Labour, SNP, Greens. What a mess it would be. <HASHTAG/> bbcDebate
Corbyn's own MPs told him to go, candidates won't put him on election leaflets - if they won't have him, why should the country? <HASHTAG/> bbcDebate
More arguing between the coalition of chaos -Lab/Lib/Green, less a progressive alliance, more a backwards step. <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
IFS said black hole on Labour tuition fees costings, and on childcare too. <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
Corbyn, Libs, SNP arguing, gives us early sight of what their coalition of chaos will be like. No plan on Brexit, as can't agree. <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Labour always spend more, borrow more, the real budget they raise is debt interest = less money for public services, not more. <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
2.8m jobs created since 2010 by businesses that Corbyn and the Greens want to tax - incl SMEs, the backbone of our economy. <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
Labour left youth unemployment up by nearly 50%. No plan for Brexit, a Lab/Lib/SNP coalition of chaos and tax rises, to take UK backwards.
Corbyn's coalition of chaos will wreck our economy with highest tax burden for years <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate

<HASHTAG/> BBCQT Are there circumstances when JC would use a nuclear deterrent? Response shows JC has totally unrealistic view of national security.

<NAME/> <NAME/> No, we are allowed to knock on doors/speak to people on polling day  &  ask if they've had a chance to vote.

<NAME/> But there will be higher unemployment under Labour's job destroying plans so they won't get job security at all
Delaying our election would be unacceptable. We vote to elect our leaders  &  must never allow fanatics  &  murderers to stop us
These cowardly murders are an attack on our way of life  &  an attempt to undermine our democracy. That must fail. We vote this Thursday
Lovely to catch up with <NAME/> today, working hard as always for <HASHTAG/> Torbay Best wishes for Thursday  &  Saturdâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> I agree, I have also worked on a zero hours contract in the past but called it a flexible contract to fit in with studies.
Sadly a Labour govt would destroy jobs, wreck the economy, endanger our nation's security  &  leave others to clear up the mess (again).
Another myth that is trotted out at hustings is around income inequality so here are the facts <LINK/>
<NAME/> So why didn't Labour act to put an end to their restrictive exclusivity clauses when they were in power for 13years?
.banning zero hours contracts altogether would deny this option to both the 2.8% of employees who use them  &  employers  &  put jobs at risk
.absolutly right for Conservatives to have put an end to zero hours contracts that prevented ppl working elsewhere. Labour failed to do so
Contrary to the myths: Only 2.8% of people in employment are on a zero hours contract  &  of these 2/3 do not want more hours.

Goodbye to the NHS's internal market, 'which can fail to act in the interests of patients and creates costly bureaucracy'. Good!
'If current legisln is slowing implementation or preventing accountability, we will consult  &  make necessary legislative changes'...it is!
<NAME/> Probably not as the care cap metering would have been a huge cost and this has been dropped
<NAME/> Long overdue, many new health professionals like physician associates are currently unregulated. This is a patient safety issue
.i would urge govt in forthcoming green paper to introduce a govt backed insurance to allow ppl to insure against social care costs
.Also need to know whether the Â£100,000 asset threshold is subject to a taper rate below that? Hopefully not as that would reduce its value
.it would be a false economy to see delays arise because of difficulty meeting short term care funding.
.if wanting to avoid delayed transfers we must facilitate rapid access to free short term care packages whether at home or residential
Qns on social care from me on poss unintended consequences of policy on home care costs: 1. will the 12 week 'disregard' be retained? Thread
Welcome prioritisation 'that the 140,000 staff from EU countries can carry on making their vital contribution to our health  &  care system'

Some responders sadly prefer unconditionally to believe  &  accept the Juncker line rather than accept that this is a negotiation
I'm not backing Juncker  &  don't want a PM that will cave at EU's first set of demands. Constructive negotiations in Britain's interest <HASHTAG/> May
Coalition of libdem/labour would simply roll over  &  agree to all EU demands. We need strong Conservative leadership not jelly

2/2 routine Sunday GP appointments an example of political priority interfering with clinical priority
<NAME/> Quite!
Frank about improvements  &  pressures but Stevens points out that funding is a political decision when asked about paying more vs doing less
Stevens rightly condemns homeopathy on the NHS
Really we don't have enough GPs to staff front door of A & E, continuity of care, out of hours centres  &  routine Sunday surgeries. 1/2
18 week target for treatment remains but NHS will prioritise urgent  &  emergency care. Stevens on <NAME/>

3. Suicide is the leading cause of death in young people aged 15-24  &  of men under 50 but we don't treat this with the urgency is deserves

Very clear only Theresa May can be trusted with Brexit negotiations and our country's security. Corbyn weak and evasive. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Obfuscating on IRA and Trident. Corbyn hasn't changed hard left views. Danger to our economic and national security. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Evading the question on using nuclear weapons again. Corbyn would endanger our country's security. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
IFS says Corbyn manifesto would lead to the highest peacetime levels of taxation. Everyone would pay- businesses and people. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Commanding performance from PM. Exactly who we need leading us through Brexit and beyond. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
1.8 million more children going to good and outstanding schools since 2010. We are putting more money in and sharing it more fairly. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Prime Minister honest and straightforward about challenges we face as a country. Corbyn  &  co - claim magic wand can be waved. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM right. Public want us to get on with it. And she is the tough negotiator who can deliver Brexit. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Prime Minister shows determination to respect will of British people on Brexit. Coalition of chaos led by Corbyn would not.<HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Vital we have Theresa May at the helm at this crucial time. Negotiations will start 11 days after election.<HASHTAG/> bbcqt

Strong statement from Amber on the PM's record of delivery, strength and support of her team. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

Jeremy Corbyn demonstrating that he's never had to make any tough choices. His plans are not credible. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber points out we are seeing the Coalition of Chaos in action. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn refuses to make any commitment on reducing immigration. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
It's very easy to find ways to spend money - much harder to raise it. Amber nails it. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn doesn't understand putting business taxes up will not help jobs, growth or wages. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber's facts and clarity beating <HASHTAG/> coalitionofchaos hands down. Employment at record levels. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
There's no magic money tree - Amber Rudd only person in this debate who gets that. Others=unfunded promises. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber right to say good Brexit deal vital for economy and public services. Corbyn has no plan. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Home Secretary makes only credible opening statement that reflects the real challenges we face.<HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

PM understands need to bring down immigration and to address skills gap by training up more people here. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
PM right to point out that raising taxes will not help those just about managing. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
PM open about hard choices and showed strength of character. Corbyn full of bluster and denials. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
PM right this is a vital moment in our country's history. We need a "difficult woman" to lead us through. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Clear only Theresa May should be leading the Brexit negotiations that start 11 days after election.<HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10

Strong, honest answer from PM on social care. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Crime came down under Theresa May as Home Secretary. Her reforms ensured money was spent better.<HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
It is clear Corbyn's view hasn't changed on the Falklands or Hamas. Very dangerous.<HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn would dither rather than make the tough decisions that are needed for our country's security. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
All over the shop on benefits. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn doesn't agree with his own manifesto on nuclear weapons. How can we trust what he would do? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn not answering nuclear question. Lots of waffle. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Lots of promises. No idea how to pay for it. Result= highest peacetime tax burden.<HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn won't say whether immigration would go down under Labour. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
The idea of Corbyn negotiating Brexit very concerning. He would not get a good deal. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn weak on terrorism when we face grave threat. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn denying his past siding with IRA. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn not answering question about his foreign policy. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10

Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT End of 2nd Half. I repeat: this format far more beneficial than shouting matches to date. Justified PM choosing this option
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Corbyn will raise Corp tax to 26%. In 2010 Corp Tax was 28% and raised Â£43bn. In 2016 it was 19% and raised Â£49bn. Go figure
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT It there it is again - Corbyn REFUSING to shoulder responsibility of keep our nation safe. That is the FIRST duty of any PM.
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Corbyn's defence of the IRA is simply shocking. He has just refused to directly condemn the deaths they caused.
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Politics aside-having served in British Army  &  still in the TA -DEEPLY concerned Corbyn might EVER command our nuc deterrent
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Pleased to hear Corbyn wanting to fight racism in any form. But many have commented this must include within his OWN party.
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Contrary to what Jeremy Corbyn just claimed: Corp Tax will go UP 19p to 21p under Labour's plans
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT First 1/2 over. Format is mature, robust  &  detailed. Those watching will have learnt more about PM+ polices than Weds debate
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Very pleased to see PM robust and committed on <HASHTAG/> climatechange <HASHTAG/> Parisclimateaccord and said as much directly to Pres Trump.
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Key point about need for a strong economy to ALLOW increased funding for our important public services - no magic money tree
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT Key Q what should be in Pty manifestos? PM opted for clarity/honesty about tough challenges-easy route would be to omit them
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQTT Key point about Brexit result: All MUST accept the REF result  &  all must work to ensure UK makes a success our new outlook
Watching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT PM reminds us that Brixit negotiations start just 11 days AFTER Gen Election-nation must choose who will best represent us.

<NAME/> Not true. Mid Beds parents are well educated enough to see that for themselves. Great schools with excellent outcomes
<NAME/> I'm actually from Liverpool and Sunderland was a massive leave vote
<NAME/> That's nonsense and bcse our parents tend to be well informed and educated, they know that
<NAME/> Thank you so much xx
A little helper came too and her name is Dorie <HASHTAG/> ToryDorie <LINK/>
<NAME/> Actually, not a single one. Ampthill is a very courteous Town!
Lots of toots and peeps and thumbs up this morning in sunny Ampthill <HASHTAG/> IstandwithTheresaMay <HASHTAG/> Conservative GE2017 <LINK/>
Forget the spats - check out the facts. Life IS better under a Conservative Government <HASHTAG/> GE2017 <LINK/>
How do the LibDems get away with these lies _Ÿ˜‚ <LINK/>
Wow, so, basically all you wealth creating tax payers who fund our public services, Corbyn is not your fan man <LINK/>
When Corbyn thinks he's done well, he jumps backwards. Glad Theresa May doesn't do that. <HASHTAG/> odd <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
No commitment to condemning IRA. Instead throws his net over all terrorists. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
'I'm not going to stop you workin, it's ok.' He seriously thinks he's going to be PM on June9th <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Is the next question going to be 'why is it that 3/4 of your MPs can't and won't support you?' <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Michael is right <LINK/>
Corbyn is going to get the whole world to disarm. This man is a God. He thinks. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
He doesn't know the answer. The questioner in the audience understands principles of peace keeping more than Corbyn does <HASHTAG/> BBCQt
Corbyn is a Hamas supporter he's lying through his teeth now <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyns tax increase will cripple small/medium business- make us uncompetitive against countries like Ireland and slump the economy <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Time for some tough Qs for Corbyn. Everyone notice he mentioned Starmer but forgot Abbott and Thornberry? <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
I'm proud of the boss tonight and judging by my phone, we all are. <HASHTAG/> IstandwithTheresaMay
Keri Starmer is a leading lawyer in the country? I thought he was an MP. We have lots of QCs lawyers in Westminster <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
TM has spoken to Trump, not written a letter. She told Trump she felt the agreement was important for the world. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Student loan forgiveness for students who become teachers and remain in teaching <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
A nonsensical question based on fantasy promises made by Labour re school funding <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Question is upsetting and hard. TM is demonstrating not just compassion re mental health but understanding and detail of the issue <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
The state take the house and the money NOW. You are left with 23k we are leaving 100k and setting a cap. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Sharp put down for DD 'I'll answer the question I was asked' <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
She's storming this! <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
The yobbish voice in the audience has raised its head and what a surprise, an anti Tory Corbynista <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
'It would have been the easiest thing in the world not to have called an election' she's right <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
TM is contested by a hard core of remainers including Tim Farron who wants to ignore the British people and the result <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Theresa May setting the record straight on her record as Home Secretary She's taking the toughest questions of all - from the public <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
<NAME/> How about just if the audience jeer the interviewer when they ask Corbyn a question ??
Will this be yet another momentum rigged audience? <LINK/>
The yobbery arrived with Corbyn <LINK/>
<NAME/> That's just rubbish I'm afraid
<NAME/> Oh, I don't know 1.5 million sales is something I'm quite proud of
Thank you <NAME/> 'someone who supports terrorists is not fit to be Prime Minister' It would be dark, bad frightening days for Britain
<NAME/> No because you still pay council tax LVT will be in addition to CT
Corbyns Marxist dream - we all live in concrete blocks, grow our own veg on allotments, wear the same clothes earn the same and be happy
Retired teacher in 500k house told me voting Corbyn! Good luck with that bcse neither pension nor garden will survive Corbyns taxes
Look at the land tax in Labour manifesto - if you own a garden now, you may not be able to for much longer
Forget all the shouty ranty stuff and just take a quick glance at what life is actually like under a Conservative Gâ€_ <LINK/>
Corbyn has got something right. He digs and plants, I write books <HASHTAG/> creativity <LINK/>
<NAME/> If you have a garden and are thinking of voting Labour, you might want to check out Corbyns garden taâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> will walk away with the higher ratings then? <LINK/>
Audience jeered the chair when a less than friendly Q was asked of Corbyn and cheered Corbyn for very little That aâ€_ <LINK/>
A true socialist. Him <LINK/>
You don't even understand the difference between debt and deficit? How can you lead us when you appear to be clueleâ€_ <LINK/>
Corbyn changed his mind in the afternoon and decided to attend - did he suddenly get word that the audience was his? <LINK/>
<NAME/> Lol! Glad you read it, Gareth! Hope you are well and enjoying campaign
Worse than that. It's portraying women as unprofessional idiots who don't care about policy, they just want a niceâ€_ <LINK/>
Will we see clips today on the <HASHTAG/> BBC of Corbyn refusing to call the Manchester bomber a terrorist?
Corbyn decided to attend only in last few hours. Word must have reached him that Momentum had stacked the audienceâ€_ <LINK/>
I think Corbyn is arrogantly waltzing into a false sense of security and confidence. Someone turn the music up
'Our government needs to be at its strongest through Brexit' great closing statement from <NAME/> <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate <HASHTAG/> battleforno10
And, there's a lot of them <LINK/>
Great answer from <NAME/> majority of Corbyn MPs don't support him How can he lead? <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
That's not right - LW said 'tell him he's wrong' that's what <NAME/> responded to <LINK/>
Great put down from <NAME/> 'that's not how diplomacy works' Hear hear <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
So, that's 3 UKIP members in the audience <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
And that's Corbyns thugs ? <LINK/>
Bang_Ÿ’¥another hit for <NAME/> Corbyn boasts has opposed anti terror legislation to pass through Parl since 1983 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn, the man who takes tea, issues invites to, shares platforms with and honours terrorists <HASHTAG/> bbcdebate
It's losing it now. The chairing is slipping away People reaching for the off button everywhere <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Tim Farron not saying that the system is that your house is taken now, before death <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate he's blatantly lying
Angus Robertson criticises Theresa May for not being there but neither is <NAME/> ! What hypocrisy <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Where are all the billions coming from that Corbyn wants to spend? You, that's where. <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Balanced audience my backside. All the Green Party members in there? <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Bang_Ÿ’¥ Amber highlights what a progressive alliance would look like. Fights and childish squabbles <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
I like <NAME/> She's doing a good job, so far <HASHTAG/> BBCdebate
Immigration of unskilled has to be reduced to remove pressure on NHS schools housing etc Labour plan to open the floodgates <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Diane Abbott could be Home Secretary on Friday. Please do your bit to stop that happening by voting Conservative onâ€_ <LINK/>
Everyone should be safe from abuse. I am glad to be supporting the <HASHTAG/> SafeAtHome campaign. <LINK/> <LINK/>
People who've never voted Conservative, people who've always voted Conservative. All voting <HASHTAG/> Conservative on 8 June: <LINK/>
Yet more poignant after last night, <HASHTAG/> OneLoveManchester is so moving and defiant. Thank you to all who made it happen
Prime Minister is exactly right in her response to the terrible attack on London Bridge last night <LINK/>
Thoroughly enjoyed Great Wratting village fete today - gorgeous weather and the world-beating Haverhill Brass Band <LINK/>
Exactly. He would put every families' economic security at risk <HASHTAG/> BBCQT <LINK/>
Every voter should have the chance to see that awful performance by Corbyn, but if you don't, here's a summary:â€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> Actually, it did
<NAME/> Did, actually
I hope audience was high for <HASHTAG/> BBCQT. Corbyn showed he can't be trusted on defence, economy, business or choosing the right side on terrorism
All day today people have told me they'll leave the country if Labour win. Tonight Jeremy Corbyn showed why <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Jeremy Corbyn has no idea how the economy works <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
The revenue from Corporation Tax has RISEN as rates have been cut. How would Corbyn pay for this tax rise? <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Jeremy Corbyn is unfit to be Prime Minister <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Why won't Jeremy Corbyn condemn the IRA by name when asked? <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn's complete failure to understand business shows jobs  &  the economy are at risk under Labour <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
The Labour manifesto proposes paying for everything from a magic money tree <HASHTAG/> BBCQT <LINK/>
Corbyn demonstrates once again he doesn't understand how business works or how jobs are created <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
But Labour have committed to a rise in Small Business corporation tax rate <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn opens claiming he has a great team - somehow forgot to mention Diane Abbott <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Excellent performance by the Prime Minister on top form <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
It's that magic money tree again... <LINK/>
You can see that the PM knows and cares about tackling mental health  &  bringing parity of esteem with physical health <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Truth is, you can only put more money into the NHS if you have a strong economy. There isn't a magic money treeâ€_ <LINK/>
Social care policy clearly explained by Theresa May - thoughtfully tackling the big long term answers <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Theresa May hits the ball out the park on having a second referendum on Brexit. We must get on with it - and get the best deal <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
True <LINK/>
The stronger the question, the better the answers from Theresa May. Showing the strength needed to deliver the best Brexit deal <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Good explanation from Theresa May of why no deal is is better than a bad deal <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Worry about the risk of a coalition of chaos under Jeremy Corbyn is coming up more and more on the doorstep <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Very positive audience reaction to Theresa May's clear position on dealing with Brexit. Clear May is best person to negotiate Brexit. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Very strong start from Theresa May in <HASHTAG/> BBCQT  &  positive reaction from the audience
A good morning's campaigning in Mildenhall  &  Barton Mills. People worried about Corbyn propped up by the SNPâ€_ <LINK/>
Thanks for a delicious meal <NAME/> <LINK/>
Brilliant performance by Amber Rudd tonight â€“ an authoritative voice amidst discord  &  chaos all around her <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Jeremy Corbyn so weak; carried along by the shambles of Greens, Lib Dems  &  SNP <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Today's debate has shown what a coalition of chaos under Jeremy Corbyn would look like. You can stop it by voting Câ€_ <LINK/>
Tonight weâ€™ve seen Labour, Greens, Liberals, SNP, all competing to out-spend each other with other people's money <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
But Jeremy, 3/4 of your MPs don't have confidence in you - why should anyone else? <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
A record 24% of energy was from solar in the UK last week - over 9/10 of solar panels in the UK have been installed since 2010 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber Rudd nails it: Jeremy Corbyn boasted he opposed every piece of anti-terrorist legislation since 1983 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber Rudd spot on: you can only fund good public services with a strong economy. The coalition of chaos would sink the economy <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber Rudd nails it: demonstrates total chaos of the other parties in a coalition <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
This <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate is what a coalition of chaos looks like: no economic plan; no plan to control immigration; no plan for Brexit
Jeremy Corbyn refuses to promise to cut immigration. It's clear only the Conservatives have a plan to control immigration <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn muddles up the debt and the deficit. Labour plans would add billions to borrowing <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Receipts from corporation tax have risen while the rates have come down Â <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Amber Rudd spot on about <NAME/> : "I know there's no tax you don't want to raise" <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
People on lowest incomes have seen sharpest pay rises due to the National Living Wage <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
SNP back tax rises - which would hit ordinary working people. Highest taxed part of the UK is SNP Scotland <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Jeremy Corbyn gets facts wrong in very first answer: living standards have risen, not fallen, in the past seven years <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Jeremy Corbyn forgot to mention the biggest issue facing the country after the election: Brexit <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Less than a minute for Corbyn to start talking about higher taxes - but Labour's plans would see the highest taxes since 1940s <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Looking forward to <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate tonight
Great day campaigning in <HASHTAG/> Chester - city of my birth - with my old friend  &  brilliant local candidate Will Gallagher <LINK/>
Crikey <LINK/>
Tonight showed who you want in charge of Britian's security, Economy  &  Brexit negotiations: Theresa May not Jeremy Corbyn <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
The biggest issue in this election is Brexit  &  comparison between Theresa May vs Jeremy Corbyn is very clear <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Prime Minister unflustered by Paxman questioning on Brexit and immigration  &  completely across the figures <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Big applause for Theresa May for saying on Brexit "I believe we're doing the right thing in making a success of Brexit" <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Theesa May, strong and clear - sharp contrast to Jeremy Corbyn running from his record <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Strong from the PM: "If what it takes is to be a difficult woman, that's exactly what I will be" <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Clear, clam explanation from the PM on the future of the NHS - without a strong economy you can't have a strong NHS <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
PrIme Minister strong, considered response to question about winter fuel payment  &  protecting less well off pensioners <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Strong answer from the PM on social care - clear, straightforward, explanation <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Strong first two answers by the PM: strong on security  &  strong on support for pensioners <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
When it comes to keeping people safe, the police budget is protected  &  crime is down by a third since 2010 <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
This man could be PM in 11 days time - he wants everyone to think he's changed his mind on all his support for terrorists <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn can't get his beliefs into his manifesto  &  can't get the backing of his MPs - why should he get backing of voters? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
How can we trust Corbyn to keen us safe when his Shadow Chancellor supports the abolition of MI5? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn started this interview saying he "wrote" the Labour manifesto - now he's distancing himself from it <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn can't carry his own party - his MPs don't back him - so why should anyone else? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn refusing to say he would be prepared to press the nuclear button. Not a credible Prime Minister <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn's answer to question about small business shows he doesn't understand business <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn rightly taken apart by a small businessman for being anti-aspiration <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn "won't be held to" reducing immigration <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Labour have admitted that Corbyn's tax plans would lead to the highest tax burden since the war <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
No surprise voters don't want to see Corbyn running the country. A majority of his MPs have no confidence in him - why should anyone else?
Jeremy Corbyn's denying that he backed the IRA - he invited them to the Commons just after they'd bombed Brighton
First question is on foreign policy: Jeremy Corbyn can't answer a simple question about whether he'd tackle ISIS in Syria <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Looking forwrd to seeing Jeremy Corbyn properly scrutinised tonight on <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10 on his support for IRA  &  unsuitability for office
Nicola Sturgeon is clear: she would prop up Corbyn in No10. Awful prospect. Only way to stop it from happening is tâ€_ <LINK/>
People want a Prime Minister  &  Home Sec who will stand up for Britain. Corbyn  &  Abbott are simply not up to the job <LINK/>
This is pretty unique viewing...I can't quite bear to watch to the end <LINK/>

A calm, measured and resolute response to a terrible atrocity <LINK/>
Corbyn exposed as never before tonight - higher taxes and borrowing - lower growth and lowered defences - a disaster for Britain <HASHTAG/> bbct
The iPlayer comes into its own <LINK/>
Correct <LINK/>
<NAME/> quite right Mark - red flag replaced by white flag
PM - back of the net every time - JC - a series of tragic own goals <LINK/>
Sir Nicholas nails it <HASHTAG/> ateverymomentofnationalperilaChurchillshowsthewayandweshouldheedthisancestralvoiceofwisdom <LINK/>
We should listen to <NAME/> - a brave man who fought for peace <LINK/>
Corbyn can't bring himself to unequivocally condemn IRA killers who targeted innocents and British squaddies - he can't keep us safe <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
We all are! I just hope they're not watching in Tehran and Pyongyang <LINK/>
Corbyn totally tanking on defence and the deterrent - he says he would NEVER use trident - he'd leave us open to nuclear blackmail <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
JC can't be trusted on defence or fighting terror - instead of speaking up for UK he'd just sing kumbaya <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
<NAME/> actions speak louder than words
JC just doesn't care about the anti semites in his ranks <LINK/>
Absolutely <NAME/> gets to the heart of his hypocrisy <LINK/>
<NAME/> but then he thinks Hizbollah and Hamas are friends <HASHTAG/> everydayantisemitism <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
How can Corbyn excuse Ken's anti-semitism in this way? <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
That <HASHTAG/> bbcqt questioner is right - the Labour Manifesto is a letter to Father Christmas - but reading it - there ain't no sanity clause
He's been flirting with the SNP all week <HASHTAG/> CoalitionOfChaos <HASHTAG/> bbcqt <LINK/>
Too right top chum - he will fold like a cheap deck chair in a hurricane <LINK/>
Absolutely <LINK/>
She bossed it <LINK/>

PM in command of the issues, facts and arguments - dealing with tough questions with aplomb

Nadine knows whereof she speaks <HASHTAG/> angel <HASHTAG/> bbcqt <LINK/>
On Social Care PM crystal clear - both a cap on what anyone pays and a floor which guarantees savings protected <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM quite right on manifesto - Conservatives only party to be straight about the big challenges Britain faces - and show leadership <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
On Brexit deal PM is calm, clear, coherent - she will deliver what we voted for <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

True Dat <LINK/>

PM nails it - only the Conservatives believe in respecting the referendum result and delivering a successful Brexit <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

Corbynâ€™s chaotic performance showed exactly why he cannot be trusted with Britainâ€™s future through Brexit and beyond. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Clear chasm between weak, waffling  &  testy Corbyn  &  strong, clear positive leadership of Theresa May tonight. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn: â€˜Fight all the cuts â€“ except those in the armed forces where we want to see a few more cutsâ€™ (20 October 2010). <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn talks about armed forces, when he wanted to see them cut <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn economics again missing fact that our corporation tax policy is bringing in MORE money  &  more jobs! <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn participated in a minuteâ€™s silence to honour eight IRA terrorists including the notorious â€˜Executionerâ€™....not fit to be PM <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn: â€˜Iâ€™m happy to commemorate all those who died fighting for an independent Irelandâ€™ (May 1987). <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
This performance by Corbyn.....cannot imagine him negotiating Brexit in just 2 weeks time! Shocking!! <HASHTAG/> BBCQt
Corbyn is struggling with any even slightly difficult questions, getting testy <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn being skewered again on his economic policies of the magic money tree. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn won't cut immigration, he sees no problem with it continuing to rise. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn failing key test for a PM, will he know how to keep Britain safe: no! <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn absolutely skewered over his record â€“ he is just not up to the job of PM. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn already said he doesn't agree with everything in his own manifesto  &  clearly won't be prepared to keep us safe. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Scary and worrying thought.... <LINK/>
Corbyn failing to get even close to answering question on keeping Britain safe. Labour cannot be trusted with our security. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
<NAME/> Not done that. Met and listened and always will.
Corbyn has said Hamas and Hezbollah were his 'friends' <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Labours economic fantasy plans would crash our economy  &  will put school funding  &  NHS funding at risk. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
PM outlines why education is so important  &  how we deliver quality. 1.8m more pupils in good  &  outstanding schools now. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT

Debated Diane Abbott at <NAME/> event. Genuinely worrying to think that she could be Home Sec. Wanted to disband MI5! <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative

<NAME/> gives a strong  &  clear closing with clear positive reason to vote <NAME/> on June 8 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn closes and yet again 'forgets' to even mention Brexit! <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
So what have we learnt from the debate this eve: coalition of chaos = higher taxes, a second brexit vote  &  more debt. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Did Corbyn just forget we voted to leave the EU? 11 days after the General Election we begin Brexit negotiations  &  not a word! <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
172 labour MPs told Corbyn they had no confidence in him!! <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Not a single question where <HASHTAG/> coalitionochaos has not ended up in childish spat on <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
<NAME/> gives clear  &  honest answer on climate change question such a contrast to rest of the panel <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Says everything that on such an important matter as security the coalition of chaos just end up shouting at each other <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
<NAME/> the only member of the panel to outline a plan to keep our country safe. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn forgets he didn't even vote for investigatory powers act last year! <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

Corbyn forgetting his own shadow chancellor wanted to cut police money by another 10%! <HASHTAG/> BBCDEBATE
Corbyn lies again, police money has been protected since 2015. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn has not costed his nationalization program, will drive up debt  &  taxes  &  cut investment <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
<NAME/> the only one giving clear direct answers  &  being honest about how we must ensrue we are ecnomiclly sound <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

<NAME/> the only panel member to point out how important it is to ensure the rights of British citizens abroad, rest don't! .<HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Corbyn unable to say he will end free movement after Brexit, no plan  &  no idea <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Leaked Labour Document Shows Plan to Keep Unskilled Immigration Levels High Even After Brexit <LINK/>

Leave MPs are not in disagreement with the PM and we have been strongly supporting the governmentâ€™s statements and legislation on Brexit.

Taxing whilst promoting growth: <LINK/> Most peopleâ€™s definition of the rich is someone better off than themselves.
Mrs Hardup, Mrs Lucky, Mr Feckless, Mr Prudent  &  Mr Whirlwind-do we have views on which, if any, is rich  &  who should be taxed more?
If we are going to develop a better approach to taxing the better off, we first have to decide who is better off.
Who are the rich?: <LINK/>
What is the right rate for taxing income and consumption of luxuries? I would welcome your thoughts and comments. <LINK/>
It is clearly right that we will only have a successful economy if the rich share their surplus somehow with those on lower incomes.
We want to tax the rich in ways which will coax the money out of them we need for a decent society without taxing them so much they leave
The issue between socialism and commonsense is how you tax the rich, and by how much.
Sensible Conservatives want to tax the rich because we want decent public services. The richer part of the country has to pay for them.
Some of this is commonsense. Thereâ€™s no point setting out to extract tax revenues from those who have little income and no assets.
The top 1% of Income taxpayers pay 27.5% of all Income Tax, and the top 25% pay 75% of all Income tax paid. 44% now pay no Income Tax.
Hereâ€™s a surprise. I agree with the three main political parties in the UK that we have to tax the rich.

I will be appearing on <NAME/> today to discuss <HASHTAG/> Brexit.
The EU should not overplay its hand by believing the UK would not dare to just leave if there is no deal that makes sense.
The walk away option is real: <LINK/> Leaving without a deal is always going to be better for us than a punishment deal.
Once we have left the EU there will be no more directly acting Regulations that Parliament cannot vote down.
The UK Parliament cannot amend or vote down such laws, but just has to accept them as good UK law.
This is exactly how the EU legislates when it puts through directly acting Regulations.
Henry VIII legislation is a pejorative term for laws passed without Parliamentary approval. The EU has been good at using such powers.

I would be happy to offer balance to BBC coverage if they would let me make a case for the things we can change for the better after Brexit.

The EU does not wish to encourage separatist movements within EU countries by offering them easy membership.

Another election?: <LINK/> I see no need for another election. The gov has a mandate from the ref to get on with <HASHTAG/> Brexit.

The EU need tariff free trade to continue more than us. They also need good access to financial services and banking.
It is difficult to see that the UK wants anything from the negotiation that the rest of the EU does not want and need more.
A good negotiation for the UK needs to be friendly, straight forward, and with limited requests of the others.

The UK offers continental countries tariff free access to our market as long as we have the same to theirs.The choice rests with them.
The UK is clear that all EU citizens legally here can stay as long as they wish. Why is it wrong to want the same for UK citizens in the EU?
So many fail to analyse the weaknesses and difficulties on the EU side in the forthcoming Brexit talks.
One of the odd features of the protracted  &  repetitious debate about Brexit is the wish of so many to look for problems on the UK side

<NAME/> That's surprising. DM me where you live and I can take a look. Happy to send you info.
Technology companies can do more to combat radicalisation. Intelligent cooperation and technology policy is part of the solution.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Counterterrorism spending has risen; police numbers on the streets are hugely important but not sole element of the issue.
<NAME/> <NAME/> About what?
Tragic events in London see political campaigning suspended. We should mourn knowing terrorists win when they change Britain's way of life.
<NAME/> As has been widely reported this is not an official acccount and not linked to the party in any way.
Enjoyed visiting theÂ Ingoldmells  &  District Social Club yesterday with <NAME/> on its 10th anniversary. Thanksâ€_ <LINK/>

(3/4) They deserve all the support they request, and the thanks of all our country.
(2/4) We should remember our emergency  &  security services too, whose work defending the British way of life is incalculable every day.
(1/4) At 11am today the country will observe a minute's silence in memory of those who died in Manchester.
With the threat level raised following the grotesque outrage in Manchester, political campaigning remains suspended.
Shocking, tragic events in Manchester. Election campaigning has rightly been suspended until further notice.

<NAME/> I was in Skegness last Saturday, Boston yesterday and I'll be in Boston tomorrow and Saturday.

Looking forward to getting out and about on the campaign trail in Freiston, Butterwick, Benington andÂ Leverton today.
<NAME/> This is the second time you've told me I've lost it in a fortnight and we haven't even published the manifesto yet...

Friskney is (apparently) the largest village by area in the UK - and canvassing it has been an absolute pleasure. <LINK/>

<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> You'll be pleased when it's finished. In the meantime we will all have to be patient.
<NAME/> I have been annoyed by this myself! It's not exactly parliamentary business, but <NAME/> could do a recruitment drive...

<NAME/> I've met lots of local GPs over last two years and always happy to meet more.
<NAME/> I disagree; eg an UCC in front of Pilgrim A & E is unequivocally a good thing. And Lincs NHS budget rising by Â£200m.
<NAME/> Pilgrim's success is essential for the constituency. That's why good bits of STP have to happen andâ€_ <LINK/>
An honour to serve Boston  &  Skegness; delighted to be the 2017 Conservative candidate. I hope I can count on your support <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative

My parents died when I was 28 - Prince Harry has done a huge service to all of us who struggled to deal with loss. <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I think you've missed my point.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I don't think there's anything difficultâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Do you really think it's a choice between global security and the NHS? Both are plainly essential.

Very positive response to the Conservative message today in Boston, Sibsey  &  Stickford today, here with Victoria Atâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> I'm not trying to close down any debate; but respecting the result of the referendum is non-negotiable.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I'm not sure why you think I supported them or agreed with them?
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Would you not?
<NAME/> We can wait for eg IS to attack us here, or seek to defeat them at source... Not related to NHS refoâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Quite. But it's not good enough to say it's difficult so let's not bother with reconciliation.
<NAME/> <NAME/> I can't think of a single disagreement ever resolved peacefully by the two sides not talking to each other. Can you?
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Democracy is respecting the result of democratic votes.
<NAME/> That's satire.
I stand against online abuse and bullying of people in the countryside. <HASHTAG/> reportonlineabuse <LINK/> <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Always happy to meet up with you...
<NAME/> Done.
<NAME/> <NAME/> You might want to look up which way I voted before we carry this on.
<NAME/> I look forward to reading a balanced article. And maybe even a right of reply.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Shall we start with the font reminiscent of Nazi propaganda?
<NAME/> Nice try. But voters - and this topic - deserve better than to be patronised.
<NAME/> Looks about right: <LINK/>
No <NAME/> - you're being criticised for implying voting to leave was racist and bigoted. I think it's obvious whoâ€_ <LINK/>

Corbyn rattled and on the run. Still can't believe this week he only expressed concern on IRA bombing civilians, not our soldiers <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Sound bites from Corbyn - no plan for the economy and no answers. A bit like PMQs every week <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn ready to relax immigration controls and not ready to control borders <HASHTAG/> worrying <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbynistas in audience gone quiet all of a sudden. Even they realise that security of nation is key test for future PM. He failed <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
No nuclear deterrent? I guess Corbyn won't want UK to be on UN Security Council either. Weak. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Total weakness on Trident from Corbyn - but he could be prime minister this time next week unless people <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
2010 Labour minister wrote, "There's no money left." Corbyn says Labour didn't spend enough <HASHTAG/> MagicMoneyTree <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn now lieing to the British public and in denial as income gap between poorest and richest is at its lowest for 30 years <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn should know his manifesto raises corporation tax for small businesses and entrepreneurs, not be misleading the country <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corporation tax rates are down and tax receipts have gone up. Corbyn would wreck our strong economy, wreaking havoc on public services
Placards? Letters? Sounds like Corbyn would duck the tough conversations <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Sturgeon said today she'd do a deal issue by issue with Corbyn - clear he'd be propped up in an unstable coalition <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Seems Corbyn would take any deal on offer from EU <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Theresa May as PM will continue our commitment to tackling climate change and a better environment than we inherited <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Strong performance by PM - setting out clear plan for making a success of Brexit and how to make life in the UK even better <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Significant investment of Â£4bn in education while 1.7 million more children are in good or outstanding schools now than in 2010 <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Record investment in NHS, incl mental health. Further Â£8bn going in, which is higher funding per person. Only possible with a strong economy
PM straightforward on social care - people can pass on min Â£100k from assets, other parties would only allow you to pass on Â£23k <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
I voted Remain. We lost. The referendum vote was close but decisive. We need to get on with it and deliver Brexit. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Theresa May has debated Jeremy week in week out at PMQs. Meeting voters, not your opponents, is the best way to hear from those who elect PM
Brexit negotiations start 11 says after the election. Who do you want negotiating for the UK? Theresa or Jeremy and coalition of chaos

Further reflections on Brexit and grounds for cautious optimism here: <LINK/> 5/5
UK was open to trade and investment, talent and ideas before EU existed. We do not need EU structures to be dynamic and open in future. 4/5
Many Remain supporters also worried about uncontrolled immigration. Leaving EU without restoring control would be worst of all worlds. 3/5
Membership of the Single Market would mean freedom of movement continues when the desire to stop it was the motive of most Leave voters 2/5
I share many of <NAME/> goals. But their insistence on remaining a full member of the Single Market is a mistake. 1/5

"I've always voted Labour but the economy's definitely improving and I don't want to risk it going backwards." Home truths in Corby
Cameron: "with five more years, we can have more people in a job, more people owning their own home, more people in apprenticeships"
Cameron: "To make a country where people who work hard and do the right thing enjoy the good life"
Cameron: "Let the message ring out: youâ€™ve worked hard, youâ€™ve saved, the home you live in, itâ€™s yours to buy, yours to own"
Some people will always prefer to rent but everyone should have opportunity to own their home. That is what the Conservatives offer on 7 May
Conservatives will give housing association tenants the right to buy their home at discount. Owning your home is most natural human desire.

Awful scenes from London Bridge where I lived for many years. Thoughts v much with everyone involved and our emergency services.
Win 4 May - a plan 4 Brexit, not afraid 2 tackle big issues. Corbyn waffle, weak on Brexit  &  will hike taxes on families/businesses <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn lies about Hamas - invited them to parliament, calls them friends, and asked for them to come off banned terrorist list <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Again Corbyn won't condemn IRA 4 killing British soldiers  &  policemen as well as civilians. Literally cannot bring himself to do it. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Sound bites from Corbyn - no plan for the economy and no answers - except to suddenly announce spending commitment on business tax relief.
Corbyn would weaken immigration controls and won't control our borders <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn literally has got no answers on defence. Refuses to respond to questioner. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Now Dimbleby is calling out Corbyn for "dodging the question". This guy just won't defend us. A reason why 172 Lab MPs don't want him <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn won't say he'll use nuclear deterrent in last resort. So he's destroying the deterrent. Audience calls him out. Weak/dangerous <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn studiously avoiding audience question about our nuclear deterrent. Thinks if he can keep talking he can avoid question <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Audience member reminds Corbyn last labour government left no money - and Corbyn things they spent 'too little' <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corby lying about to on small business - he'll raise tax on them from 19 to 21p on small business <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn fibbing that 95% won't pay more tax. IFS says his plans just don't add up. So he'll have to tax the rest of us. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn's tax plans will drive companies out of the country hammering jobs and reducing tax yield for public services. Chaos. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn's corporation tax money tree will CUT the tax yield meaning he'll either have to borrow or tax elsewhere - as IFS points out. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn will sign any cheque to the EU and sign up to any deal however bad it might be for the UK. No plan. Shambles. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn NOT clear on Brexit. He wanted to trigger A50 immediately then back off. Then couldn't persuade Lab MPs to back him. Chaotic <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM makes clear that foreign aid helps people in need abroad but also is investment for us at home helping to keep us safe and secure <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM right that mental health discrimination in workplace must be tackled and stopped. Honest, transparent, clear. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM absolutely clear Conservatives will spend more on NHS including mental health parity of esteem. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT

Clarity on my speech yesterday, and why I feel I've been misconstrued. Please refer to my website article below. Thx <LINK/>
Pt 4: Not good choice of words from me but misconstrued - I was trying to say we must think logically not emotionally to best help kids.
Pt 3: I meant we should analyse OBJECTIVELY, not that we should not care. I visited Jordanian refugee camp out of concern, not lack of it.
Pt 2: I said â€˜we should stop being so sentimental' so as to 'actually be looking at what the best thing to do for these familiesâ€™ is.
Pt 1: Fear I have been misconstrued in speech. Claimed we must think LOGICALLY not SENTIMENTALLY in order to do best for the children.

Finally, finally it's getting lighter and anticipation on the platform grows as we wait for a 12 coach 7.34.....
<NAME/> 7.17 and 7.34
<NAME/> not good - how many carriages does it have? <NAME/>
7.17 very full - 10 standing by the loos but did get my favourite pitch and knees might manage the bend down on to sit on my bag
<NAME/> not easy to carry on a bike when cycling to the station!
7.34 train.Travelled in hope that a Friday might deliver a seat but hopes dashed despite squeezing my way through crowds to no avail
<NAME/> some more longer trains are needed....Woking crowd very cramped
No chance of a seat on 7.17 but prime standing spot by the loo. Knees too cold to sit on floor - might never un freeze to make it up again
<NAME/> please call me if you need help - 02072190017

<NAME/> Get a life Alan. Or work out the difference for yourself. It's pretty obvious. Clue: one involves killing of UK soldiers.
Weird. Corbyn's biggest spend is subsidising rich, male graduates.
<NAME/> Thanks Matt. You'll be a great councillor.
<NAME/> It's at the forefront of my mind. We haven't eliminated Labour's deficit. Debt keeps rising. It isn't time for another splurge.
Corbyn always voted to weaken the powers of our security services. Always sided with the IRA. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The only thing Corbyn's wannabe coalition partners agree on is the need to hike taxes. They'd squabble about everything else. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

We've reduced the deficit by 3/4. Corbyn wants to reverse that and mire the people of this country with even greater debts. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
If Labour lead a coalition with SNP, Greens and Lib Dems we'll have the highest taxes ever in peacetime. Record borrowing. Chaos. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
<NAME/> I enjoy offline campaigning - it's more effective and people are nicer.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Lazy and dishonest. Lib Dems. Surprised they haven't mentioned tuition fees.
<NAME/> Lib Dems have always had difficult relationship with the truth. There is no cut in East Riding schools budget. <NAME/>
<NAME/> Sorry I didn't wave
<NAME/> Hi Ben, I'm afraid not. I hope it goes well.
<NAME/> It's not that he met them. It's that he supported them.
Corbyn's cold blooded support for IRA murderers cannot be excused or disguised. <LINK/>

Theresa May will fight to get us a good deal with the EU and a deep and special partnership with our European neighbours <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Giving British people the skills they need is critical for a strong economy, that's why we have increased apprenticeships <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May takes responsibility for the decisions she's taken - no waffling evasions or excuses <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
We have an ageing society; a Conservative gov will put social care on a long term sustainable footing <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Absolutely right for Gov to respect referendum result. Theresa May is the only PM who will get the best deal for Britain <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Theresa May is the right PM to lead Britain through the challenges ahead unlike Corbyn who refuses to acknowledge them <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Conservative gov has been working with NHS to help disabled people into work creating a strong economy for everyone <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10

Corbyn struggles to remember his manifesto policies on <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Labour policy to raise corporation tax would undermine our economic security; higher taxes and fewer jobs <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Corbyn 'doesn't want to be held to' his answers on <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10 Not surprising!
Conservative government has led to record employment; Labour policies would lead to fewer jobs for young people <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn's views on IRA well documented; he can't answer the question on how to deal with terrorism on <HASHTAG/> BattleforNumber10

Corbyn said in 2014 that tolerating support for ISIS â€˜quite important in a democracyâ€™. Not up to the job of keeping our country safe.
There is never an excuse for terrorism. Jeremy Corbyn has shown today why he is not up to the job of keeping our country safe.

Troubling reports of a major incident at Manchester Arena. Hope all staff and visitors remain safe.
Today is the last chance to register to vote. Donâ€™t miss the chance to stop Corbyn getting to No 10 sign up now <LINK/>

<HASHTAG/> bbcqt Every reason to believe PM can secure good EU deal: in interests also of other countries, and crucially their international companies

<NAME/> <NAME/> Ich nichten lichten.
I know some don't like it when this is raised, but it would be appalling if we'd a Prime Minister who didn't think the IRA were terrorists.
Considering voting Labour? Happy to endorse this? <LINK/>
Met quite a few 'undecideds' on the campaign trail today. Hope they were watching <HASHTAG/> BBQT tonight.
The UK has never before faced the possibility of a Prime Minister who would be such a threat to our national or economic security <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
The IRA were terrorists. Corbyn doesn't seem to agree. Why not? <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn could have just the IRA were terrorists and condemned them. He didn't <HASHTAG/> contemptible <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Our nuclear deterrent has kept us safe for decades. By this time next week, we could have lost it under Prime Minister Corbyn <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
If there are no circumstances in which you'd use a nuclear weapon, you haven't got a nuclear deterrent.
Clear that if Corbyn becomes PM, we immediately no longer have a nuclear deterrent <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
It took the last Labour government 11 years to wreck the public finances. Corbyn would do it in 11 weeks <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corporation tax brings in approx Â£50bn pa. Corbyn says wants to raise a further Â£30bn. Massive increase, inevitably drives away investment.
Very few advanced countries have increased corporation tax rates. Those that have quickly reversed increase. Why? Damages economy <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
TM clear that there's no magic money tree. There's a huge price to pay when governments forget that <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Forceful, practical, full of common sense. TM displaying the qualities needed to lead Brexit negotiations <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
'We need to get Brexit right' says Theresa May. Quite right. She's the right person to lead us through this <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn says leadership is about taking advice. He got the same advice from 3/4s of his MPs. 'Resign, you're not up to it.'
<NAME/> Presumably, a Corbyn government would take a similar approach. Won't update anti-terrorism legislation if needed.
Has Corbyn ever supported any anti terrorism legislation? <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
If you want more money for the NHS, you need a strong economy. Corbyn would drive the economy off a cliff <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Our corporation tax policy has increased investment, jobs and receipts. Reversing it would hit ordinary working people <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Absolute child poverty has fallen by 200,000 since 2010 <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
You can only improve living standards with a strong economy <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
There's no magic money tree. Not that you'd believe that listening to Corbyn, SNP, Greens etc <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
PM recognises that you need a strong economy to fund public services  &  that taxpayers' money should be spent wisely. Corbyn? Not so much.
Corbyn very uncomfortable on Falklands. Or the Malvinas as they would now be called if he'd had his way <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn's anti-business approach will drive investment away from the UK <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn said he commemorated 'all' those who died in the Troubles. Not what he said at the time. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10 <LINK/>
Not quite the approach you'd hope for from an aspiring Home Secretary. She has disavowed this, hasn't she? Or jusâ€_ <LINK/>
Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly refuses to condemn the IRA, then hangs up. <LINK/>
Don't like it being pointed out that Corbyn et al were IRA sympathisers? Is it because you don't believe it or you think it's irrelevant?
It is always, always, always the UK's fault. Corbyn's world view. <LINK/>
A good morning in <HASHTAG/> Berkhamsted. <LINK/>
Not an exaggeration. In Corbyn's view, the UK has always been in the wrong (e.g. Cold War, Northern Ireland, Middleâ€_ <LINK/>
Jeremy Corbyn more enthusiastic about the IRA than NATO.
Extraordinary that the leader of one of our major political parties can't distance himself from the IRA.
Taking a short break from campaigning to attend <HASHTAG/> RickyFest today. <LINK/>
Pleased to campaign for <NAME/> in Richmond. It would be great to get him back in Parliament. <LINK/>

Many thanks to the Berkhamsted Citizens Association, the audience and other SWHerts candidates for a robust but friendly hustings tonight.
<NAME/> 8pm, 17 May at Berkhamsted Town Hall.
Thinking of voting Labour? Read this. Your vote will be taken as an endorsement of the views of Corbyn's cabal. <LINK/>
Remember, every vote for Labour will be seen as an endorsement of Corbyn and his hard left cabal <LINK/>
Every Labour vote will be seen as an endorsement of Corbyn. Wavering Labour voters, take note. <LINK/>

<NAME/> <NAME/> indeed. You said I had abdicated my responsibility twice. <HASHTAG/> FakeNews
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Me too
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> There was a tragedy last week.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Rearranged
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> we were only given one date...
<NAME/> Happy to confirm my recommendation was for it to go ahead but after shadow discussion cancellation was preferred
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> By the end of Maltese presidency we will have had exactly the number of trialogues you allowed: 2
<NAME/> <NAME/> again, no. Given the agenda avoided the serious issues I suggested it go ahead.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> We are making good progress in technical meetings
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> An alternative date secured
<NAME/> Recommended trialogue go ahead despite only 'general' discussion on agenda. (flight cancellation was problem b4 as you know)
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> outside the UK and outside the EU. Quite a challenge.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> wouldn't compliance with the Acquis render this redundant?

Thanks to all those who have come out to help deliver the Conservative message in Shifnal today. Great town, great people, great schools :)
Some local Labour activists want to stop selling UK defence kit to some areas of Middle East. That would undermine vital defence jobs....
Choice on 8th: Theresa May prepared to support MI5 or Jeremy Corbyn who surrounds himself with people who called for MI5 to be abolished
Strong  &  resolute statement by PM. Welcome govt's assertive  &  new initiatives to tackle terrorism  &  extremism. Correct to challenge many..
Terrorism will not divide London. City is one of the most multi-racial  &  multi ethnic cities in the world. UK will remain strong  &  united!
Met Commissioner "we depend on them (Americans) to keep this country (UK) safe" Intel sharing critical to UK and US national security
Thoughts  &  prayers with all those affected by tonight's incident at Borough Market  &  London Bridge. Thx to brave police  &  ambulance crews.
Corbyn: no first use, no second use, nuclear deterrent no use at all!....UK's national security clearly not safe under Corbyn's leadership
Corbyn unilaterally disarms UK in full view of world. "No first use"  &  no second use renders UK nuclear deterrent redundant. Corbyn Chaos!
Shawbirch very sunny today Very positive response on the doorsteps. Also great to support Lucy Allan in Priorslee - in neighbouring Telford
Great to be out  &  about in Lilleshall today. Good to catch up with local residents  &  support their Parish Neighbourhood Plan....
It is clear that local schools would be undermined if Corbyn Chaos governed Shropshire. Only a strong economy can pay for good local schools
In an unsafe world the UK needs leadership. National Security is first duty of any government. Choice of: Corbyn Chaos or May's Leadership..
Once again, North Korea provokes its neighbours. In an unsafe nuclear world the UK needs a strong leader. Theresa May is that leader....
Beautiful sunny  &  warm 26 degrees in Church Aston. Great response on door steps  &  in stunning Church Aston gardens. Great village ::))
Good to attend pensioner hustings today. Pensioners want strong pensions through a strong economy  &  strong leadership
Thoughts  &  prayers with those affected by the appalling terrorist attack in Manchester. Terrorism will not overcome our values  &  freedoms
Beautiful sunny day in Newport. Great response on doorsteps and from the many gardeners out  &  about. Huge leafleting team....::))
Lots of folks out in Newport high street today. Great market town  &  shopping. Positive response to Conservative policy announcements....
Great to be out  &  about in Arleston today. Great response. Clear switching from Labour to Conservatives. Good news locally  &  nationally :))
Excellent questions on a wide range of subjects at TCAT this morning. Economy, car insurance, NHS, tution fees, engineering <NAME/>
Looking forward to my first general election hustings at TCAT in Wellington today. Excellent college, great courses, staff and students :)
Labour's leaked manifesto would be bad news for UK defence jobs - both uniformed  &  civilian. Many of these jobs are located in Shropshire...
Itâ€™s clear, only the Conservatives under Theresa May can provide the strong  &  stable government the United Kingdom needs in uncertain times.
Good news PM will update Equalities Act and introduce new Mental Health Act - a real boost to many suffering from mental health conditions
Congratulations to Andy Street on winning the West Midlands Metro Mayor election Experienced leadership is what the region needs <NAME/>
Senior Balkans diplomat tells me Russian funding  &  activity in Balkans is "increasing" State Dept, EU et al need to help avert new conflicts
Violence in <HASHTAG/> macedonia must end. The current political impasse must be resolved peacefully  &  democratically  &  with the consent of the people
West Midlands needs a strong voice and a strong leader. Birmingham and the region's best days are ahead. Andy Street is that strong leader!
Today's Westminster incident shows importance of armed police  &  MI5 Those in Labour calling for disarming of police  &  scrapping MI5 - wrong!
Just asked Minister of State for Exiting the EU a PQ on importance of car manufacturing in Shropshire in any Brexit trade deal. Full answer
Lab Cllrs know two 24hour A & Es not tenable because of staffing. Rather than argue for PRH alone - they argue for RSH too. More Corbyn chaos!
It appears local TWBC Labour Group trying to divert public's attention away from local roads chaos  &  bulldozing of greenfields to NHS only!
Very concerning to see 'some' at local BBC reverting to type over this election period. Where is the coverage of new cancer unit at PRH??
Despite the political bluster by local  &  hard left Corbyn followers I'm glad the SoS for Health has a VETO over any health service changes
Appears TWBC Labour politicians have been caught 'politically off side' over last week's reassurances by hospital bosses over future of PRH
In an unsafe world Corbyn casts doubt on keeping UK's nuclear defence -  &  peace. His comments are, at best, naive, at worst, very dangerous!
Sorry to hear Sir Eric Pickles is not returning to the Commons Formidable knowledge of music  &  the arts, bird warching, as well as politics!
Very pleased assurances over the women  &  children's unit staying at the PRH have now been given at the very highest level in NHS. Good news!
Neighbourhood terrorism needs neighbourhood policing. The experience of Northern Ireland policing is something the UK can share with <HASHTAG/> France
PM: bold, gutsy, intrepid. A strong campaign now ahead for Conservatives. Victory will strengthen PM's hand nationally  &  internationally
Theresa May deserves great credit for Donald Trump's recent declaration that "<HASHTAG/> NATO is no longer obsolete". A major change of minds in WH
Leader of TWBC says growth of Telford affected by downgrading of A & E? Surely patient safety first not grand designs for Telford city status!
Welsh First Minister's intervention over future of Salop A & Es proves Welsh NHS in crisis  &  need to mount cross border raids on English NHS
Johnson right to cancel Moscow visit. But if Tillerson visit goes ahead where does that leave UK  &  US joint responses to Russian aggression?
No question of UK endangering EU security - but punitive economic outcome from Brexit would weaken UK economy  &  could reduce defence budgets
Raised future of accident  &  emergency services at PRH - at Parliamentary Business Questions today. Serious questions over SaTH leadership...
Some of Trump's views on gender, race  &  religion may be distasteful, but his radical tax reforms, tbc, may bring $$ from Sea to shining Sea?
WikiLeaks is a bogus defender of freedoms. Examine how leaks damage US  &  its allies - not Russian or Chinese intel techniques. Costing lives
<NAME/> <NAME/> Ed is so right on so much. But premature to suggest Fillon's campaign has exploded.....
<NAME/> Excellent ovreview and analysis of Trump's twitter wimps and rages. CNN better for your insightful thinking of new President
Today, I asked for a Parliamentary debate on how Council's 'review' school catchment areas. TWBC should listen to <HASHTAG/> Muxton parents  &  pupils
Glad of the opportunity to discuss security in the Baltics with the Foreign Secretary earlier today. <LINK/>
Speaker is right to make a stand. But better to have a flawed US President speak at Palace of Westminster 1st, than at Grand Kremlin Palace?
Some Trump staffers are revolutionaries, having written they seek to tear down institutions, that for all their flaws, have kept the US safe
Hamon, Marine Le Pen or <HASHTAG/> Fillon2017- who would Moscow like to see as President of France? Clear links between far right in Russia  &  France
35,000 civilians facing -18 temps in <HASHTAG/> Avdiyivka, Donetsk <HASHTAG/> Oblast, Ukraine, due to Russian backed aggression. No time for unclear US messages
New US SoS Rex <HASHTAG/> Tillerson knows <HASHTAG/> Russia. Knows how deals are done  &  undone by the Russian state  &  the strengths  &  weaknesses of Russia
Minister David Jones tells packed House of Commons that UK "has no plans to leave the ECHR". Good news for global democracy  &  human rights
Glad to be joining Prime Minister  &  colleagues today in supporting Andy Street Conservative Party Candidate for Mayor of West Midlands
Pleased to be Chairing the Broadcasting (Radio Multiplex Services) Bill this afternoon. PMB
Raised importance of UK <HASHTAG/> satellite sector in Business, Energy  &  industrial Strategy questions today. Vital for UK  &  Shropshire investment
Raised issue of tariff free  &  duty free access to European Single Market post Brexit in Article 50 debate. In UK national economic interest
Hospitals, schools, NATO, satellites, human rights, Brexit, Northern Ireland, Baltics, all in last 48 hours. The varied intray of an MP.....
Telford Priory School improving, but more needed before changes to <HASHTAG/> Muxton catchment areas begin Maybe shared catchment with Burton Borough?
As Trump appoints Senior Adviser, Steve Bannon to his National Security Council, who might have the President's ear, James Mattis or Bannon?
Has Trump just made the task of the United Nations agreeing a new Preventing Violent Extremism strategy more difficult to achieve? 7 votes
As Trump picks new Supreme Court Justice,  &  possibly 2 more, Court must show it is political in its appointment only, not in its judgements!
Many wards affected by urbanisation of greenfield sites by Labour led TWBC, but few affected more than <HASHTAG/> Muxton ward. Time for TWBC to listen
Trump rightly wants to reduce imported terrorism. But Exec Order won't help improve community relations - and what of home grown terrorism?
Trump spoke today of persecution of Christian Church in Middle East. Many fleeing the 7 countries targeted by his Exec Order are Christians!
How is <HASHTAG/> foreign policy formulated? How is academia getting it right/wrong? Who leads strategic thinking in MFAs? How can it be improved...?
Trump worrying some over his foreign policy rhetoric - but it is helpful in it raises vital questions on how the West does <HASHTAG/> Foreign Policy?
Despite tough talk in Brussels re UK's Brexit deal, political change in France, Italian banking crisis, security in Baltics. EU will be busy
Ahead of PM May's visit to White House - key to free trade agreement will be issue of visas. USA  &  UK will need new 'flexible' visa regime
Congratulations to new US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki <HASHTAG/> Haley. A very capable advocate. Not to be under-estimated. <HASHTAG/> Clemson alumni
End of <HASHTAG/> Gambian crisis is a good sign Africa can sort many of its own crises. Jammeh is finally out. Barrow finally in. Credit to <HASHTAG/> Ecowas.
As world worries about Trump's re-definition of 'the West', changes to the existing world order - withdrawal of UK from <HASHTAG/> ECHR would not help
<HASHTAG/> TWBC needs to re-think new schools catchment area policy. Muxton pupils will be very badly affected - with major travel  &  transport issues
Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  &  Amb Nikki Haley both at odds with Trump over NATO  &  Russia. Good news for balance in WH. RT no T-Rex
Cyber threats to the past US election, but what strategy does the EU have to future <HASHTAG/> cyber threats to upcoming national elections in Europe?
As bust of Churchill is returned to the White House by a US President, I hope a British PM doesnt remove his bust from the Council of Europe
Russia fails to re-apply to the human rights  &  democracy body, Council of Europe, for 2017. Was likely to have its credentials challenged...
If TWCCG don't agree with Future Fit recommendation then proposals can't be advanced. If TWCCG are ignored, then legal challenge inevitable
<HASHTAG/> ICC must not use investigation of small number of UK troops in Iraq as counter-PR initiative to avoid criticism of court by African leaders
Thought: Trump's choice of engine for his 757 jet gives us insight Insisted on Rolls Royce engines not US made Pratt  &  Whitney or GE engines
Also clear, Future Fit decisions cannot be consulted upon whilst Telford  &  Wrekin CCG are in dispute with key recommendations. More delays..
When all clinical  &  financial evidence is considered, it will become clear relocating children's unit from the PRH to RSH is wrong decision!
Glad to confirm that I will be meeting Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt MP, to discuss the future of PRH. 'Future Fit' not fit for purpose...!
Republic of Ireland's Dept of Finance downgrades economic outlook for Irish economy for "next few years" according to Irish Ambassador to UK
Welsh First Minister, Carwyn Jones, says UK government needs to learn "diplomacy" in its negotiations with EU over Brexit....
Hats off to <HASHTAG/> Toblerone PR folks Changing shape of the iconic chocolate always controversial. Suspect President elect Trump - trumps that now
Whoever wins Presidency will have to engage communities, police, local govt  &  churches to end unlawful killings of Afro-Americans by police
Apart from electing a new President: Nebraska, Oklahoma  &  California will all be voting on retention and/or repeal of the death penalty <HASHTAG/> CNN
If Supreme Court upholds decision GE more likely. Some Lab MPs might be glad Head off primaries, most would keep seats  &  then see off Corbyn
As battle for Mosul continues, I look forward to hearing of the end of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
Brussels should tread carefully on Brexit. Anything that undermines UK economy will also, eventually, undermine Europe's national security.
Europe's defence would be weak without UK. From the lower Arctic to the Baltics the UK is keeping Europe safe. Brussels might remember this
My condolences to the people of Thailand. At a time of political transition, and now, national mourning, there needs to be unity and calm
I welcome decision by Pakistan's Supreme Court on Asia Bibi's case. <HASHTAG/> Pakistan needs to uphold principles of freedom of speech  &  religion
German FM refuses to answer whether Germany would use military action if Russia attacked another <HASHTAG/> NATO member. Said, "strong" response only
No doubt delight in Moscow as German FM, Steinmeier, gives weak speech to Council of Europe and suggests return of Russian MPs to PACE
All major decisions by NATO made by consensus of all 28 nations. If Russia attacked Baltic State/s how would Turkey respond? Process crisis?
Article 5, Washington Treaty (NATO treaty) does not guarantee a military response should a NATO member be attacked. Moscow not blind to this
Kaliningrad to West, Belarus to East, why <HASHTAG/> Lithuania most exposed to Russian attack. Why NATO battalion won't hold - so Poles to the rescue?
USA in transition, EU politically  &  economically weak, NATO under-funded. The Bear feels cornered  &  provoked but also strident  &  confident
So often peaceful protests outside the Russian Embassy would be right  &  proper but where do violent protests in Moscow leave our diplomats?
Irish MPs calling on France for support for seat at table between UK  &  EU on Brexit negotiations. Hollande says "taken into consideration"
Local NHS Managers need to justify why they want to reduce A & E hours at the PRH. They should immediately publish the rationale and evidence
Hollande tells CoE until France  &  UK agree policy towards "unaccompanied minors" Calais camp cannot be closed. Policy is "pre-requisite"
How Corbyn comes to power? Another banking collapse  &  a catastrophic terrorist event. Overnight political heretic becomes political prophet
Decision over relocation of health services from PRH to RSH being driven by NHS managers  &  local clinicians - not by Ministers. Labour lies!
One way for hospital trust to find funds is not to relocate the Â£30M children's unit from Telford to Shrewsbury. Huge questions to answer??
Fight is on for future of children's and A & E services at PRH. Join my campaign to protect the vital services. Sign <NAME/> <LINK/>
Good to get some fighting tips from <NAME/> Lots to fight for locally and nationally <LINK/>
Possibly most significant shift by a Republican candidate for President on guns. Trump agrees 'no fly lists' should be used for gun control
Who sits on the 80 strong non-financial benefits panel that have recommended moving the PRH children's unit to the RSH? They should be named
Plans to reduce A & E provision at the Princess Royal Hospital, incl axing children's services, is likely to be challenged by Judicial Review
Rushing to trigger Article 50 would not be in UK's national interest. PM getting Brexit navigation right, not wrong, is in the UK's interest
As Parliament prepares for its move in 2022, an alternative to Dept of Health might be Acton Burnell Castle, Salop. HoC met there in 1283 :)
Who is going to be the next UN Secretary General? Time is running out. Whoever takes over will need to tackle abuses by some UN peacekeepers
Had honour of Chairing Modern Slavery Bill through Parliament Salvation Army's excellent work - shows that, the now 'Act', is just the start
Trouble for PM, timing of Article 50, what Brexit deal looks like, voting through eventual deal, those claiming glory or distance from deal?
Next big Parliamentary bun fight will be the chairmanship  &  membership of the new Brexit and International Trade Select Cttees. DECC gone.
Three Alpha males, in Johnson, Davis  &  Fox, with over-lapping depts,  &  with an eye to their own futures, how will Alpha female manage them?
"Brexit means Brexit" - but trouble for PM is Brexit looks like so many different things to so many different MPs within Conservative Party
Are aggressive London supercar drivers above the law (many Middle Eastern)? Timid response by <HASHTAG/> Met Police on Public Spaces Protection Orders
With some companies now considering exiting Britain, what's not needed is more delay over <HASHTAG/> airport capacity. LHR  &  LGW both need new runways
Government dropping the British Bill of Rights makes sense. It would have only been a variant, albeit Anglo variant, of the ECHR anyway.
From a nation of great <HASHTAG/> comedy writers - is political correctness killing British comedy? <HASHTAG/> Little Britain  &  Harry Enfield be allowed today?
Despite some opposition in Conservative parliamentary ranks, the boundary changes will go ahead PM is political  &  will want better majority
'Compromise' the least spoken word in British <HASHTAG/> politics - but the word most experienced
Sadly, EU debate not over in Tory Party. Now, just a different narrative. In the Single Market or not? Sharp differences are yet to emerge..
Huge difference between setting up new <HASHTAG/> grammar schools  &  allowing expansion  &  satellite of existing. Former not in Conservative manifesto
Grammar schools like Adams' Grammar School, Shropshire should be allowed to expand  &  set up satellite schools but all schools need support
Perhaps a compromise on grammar schools is to allow existing grammar schools to expand, but not necessarily allow completely new schools?
As <HASHTAG/> Thailand votes in Referendum on new Constitution I hope it will be a free  &  peaceful vote and will lead to early  &  democratic elections
Should local councils own British <HASHTAG/> airports? Transport Secretary and DCLG Secretary need to review such ownership. Is owning airports core?
<HASHTAG/> Iran. Number of executions increasing. Nuclear deal appears to have eclipsed EU and USA keeping focus on continuing human rights abuses
What is happening at <HASHTAG/> lutonairport <HASHTAG/> lutoncouncil? Time for new owners and/or operators? Complete chaos, very disorganised, awful experience
PM not alone in raising security issues over <HASHTAG/> Hinkley - I raised concerns in Sept 2012  &  Aug 2014. Alternative deal needs to be struck soon
Lib Dems living on another foreign policy planet EU best placed to challenge excess of Turkey's coup crackdown - not NATO. NATO needs Turkey
Analysis of death penalty legislation and execution rates around the world does not show <HASHTAG/> Commonwealth in very good light compared to others
If PM only focuses on lifting up Britain's working class - she will have forgotten large numbers of Britain's under class. Always forgotten!
<HASHTAG/> Munich Action on legally held small arms  &  light weapons now needed by EU leaders. Also action on illegal smuggling of weapons from Balkans
The assassination of <HASHTAG/> Kiev based journalist Pavel Sheremet, often a critic of the Kremlin, may lead all the way back to Moscow? Car bomb!
There is A-series and B-series of the Philosophy of Time - then there is the <HASHTAG/> Uber philosophy of time - where 1 minute is an illusion
As a Conservative MP it would be easy to rejoice at Labour's crisis - but I am not. Every democracy needs a credible  &  believable opposition
Isn't it time Central London had a tube or rail station called <HASHTAG/> Soho? Crossrail 2 provides that opportunity - increasing London's tourism.
In an ideal world no country would possess nuclear weapons - but we do not live in an ideal world. Unilateralism would undermine UK security
If <HASHTAG/> Turkey reintroduces death penalty it will have to leave Council of Europe (PACE) which would undermine its claim to uphold democracy
Very significant events in Turkey. Important that peace  &  democracy restored as soon as possible. Key ally for NATO and fight against Daesh
French police right to shoot dead Nice attacker. Could have had a truck bomb too. Istanbul airport attack underlines need to shoot to kill
Thoughts and prayers with the people of the city of Nice this morning. An awful and terrible attack on innocent people. We will overcome!
Whilst EU is rightly focused on the Minsk talks needing to make progress the ruthless oppression of Crimea's Tatars should not be forgotten

<NAME/> Hi Stewart, not sure what that icon means and if you require a further response?
To be fair, Ed Balls is a much better dancer than I thought he'd be. And very entertaining. Has my vote.
Good to see milk prices starting to rise significantly. At last, prospects looking good for dairy farmers. About time too.
Personally, never thought of academics as 'experts'. No experience of the real world.
Nothing more irritating than academics rubbishing the efforts of those operating at the sharp end, without facing up to the hard decisions.
<NAME/> why ask me? You know I support the Bill. Would have thought your journalistic inquisitiveness would lead you to ask them
<NAME/> perhaps you could start with Richard Wyn Jones. He gives impression he wants Wales Bill to fall. Then ask their Lordships
<NAME/> <NAME/> do you ever ask them if they want the Wales Bill to fall? Or are they offered a cost-free platform to complain?
<NAME/> <NAME/> are you opposed to the Wales Bill Richard ? You give impression that you are. Your opinion matters to me.
<NAME/> and what is wrong with support and assurances. Exactly what I would expect and hope for.

So cross about negativity towards fantastic Nissan decision to build two new models in UK that written blog post at <LINK/>
<NAME/> disappointed to see no place for Lembit.
Reassuring to see UK economic growth performance remains strong. Defying prediction. Hard to understand why some refuse to accept good news.
Best wishes to my colleague, Nick Boles. Put the big C back in its box. We need his good sense and positivity in full flow in parliament
I thought Zac was a great MP. Agreed with him on so much, especially casual use of antibiotics. Hope he's re-elected. Unless there's a Tory.
Good to see Theresa May involving Wales, Scotland and N Ireland in Brexit talks. All working in the UK interest.
The more impolite and shirty that EU leaders are to the UK and our PM, the more sure we'll become that Brexit was/is the right decision.
Whenever I hear Plaid Cymru speakers saying they accept the EU referendum result, can't decide whether they are dissembling or joking.
What's the betting on Tom Newton Dunn's tip that Ed Balls will be elected Labour leader in 2020.
Interesting to hear Hilary Benn calling for "transition arrangements" at end of 2yrs post invocation of Article 50. Is this now Lab policy?
Good to see a 'girl next door' growing up to contest leadership of a UK party. Suzanne Evans grew up just over Offa's Dyke in Shropshire.
If Leanne Wood and Plaid Cymru want to replace Labour, running Welsh Govt, they should seek to work with the Welsh Conservatives.
<NAME/> <NAME/> daft idea to only allow persons living in Wales to stand for Welsh Parl't. Welsh voters will decide who they want
Brilliant All Blacks. My dream holiday Eden Park for a Lions game.
So no trade deal between EU and Canada. What price TTIP now? The UK must really go for our own trade deals. EU systemically unable to do it.
22nd yr in succession, EU Court of Auditors refused to sign off EU Annual Budget - "materially affected by error".
Marmite price increases not that important. But not Kit Kats surely. If Twix and Topic prices jump up, my life will be much diminished.
Honours Forfeiture Committee should look at all recipients of honours, including Mr Greene, and un-honour all who've behaved dishonourably.
Is it me, or is there less wine in a bottle than there used to be ?
Great to see Sam Davies in the Welsh squad. Good to know the No 10 production line is still functioning ok.
Bruce Springstein was the best rock singer the world has ever seen
Energy and Climate Change Committee until last week; Global Warming Foundation tonight. Good science looks at both sides of the ledger.
Always thought Shami Chakrabarti to be a top woman. OK, bit too much of a 'leftie' for me, but really pleased to see her a Baroness.
Good to see at least some of the Calais children, qualified under the Dublin regulation, coming to join their families in UK
Shocked to hear of Anthony Foley's death. So very young. Top player for Ireland, and big loss for Irish rugby. Sympathy to family/friends.
The US Pres election becoming a total farce. Trump calling for drug tests before pre-election debate. Really. Rather vote for Mickey Mouse.
I really can't see how there can be a vote by MPs before Article 50 is invoked. Tantamount to refusing to accept Referendum vote (imo)
Love it. Typical Rhodri. All Labour have to do is chat to Dafydd El and offer a few schools in Meirionydd to fix the Assembly budget!!!

Diane James to stand down as UKIP leader. What's the betting 'The Farage' will be back! Dragged protesting but succumbing to popular demand.
<NAME/> <NAME/> personally I agree with William Hague and support a 'Goldilocks' breakfast - neither soft not hard.
I do not like or approve of referendums. But if one is held (in Britain) the voice of the people must be honoured.

Excellent first budget by <NAME/> - skills, economic growth, NHS, social care, Brexit. Building a country that works for everyone

Right of <NAME/> to acknowledge pressure on social care. Â£2bn over next 3 years and new measures for tackling delayed hospital discharge
T-Levels are an important step to tackling the parity gap between academic and technical education. Â£500 for 16-19 yo's for skills they need
Will be keeping a keen eye on tomorrow's Midlands Engine strategy. Vital for our region that we have a clear plan
Important fund of Â£690m for councils to tackle congestion  &  local transport. Key priority of mine in WM to make sure we are better connected
Â£300m for research on science, technology and engineering- important for WM economy especially. We need to support our future inventors
By the end of this Parliament we will be spending Â£6bn on childcare - this is important for working families
Pleased that personal allowance will rise for 7th year in a row to Â£11,500 - was Â£6,475 in 2010

<NAME/> we all want peace, but it's the willingness to hit back that deters - that's what's worked for 70 years! <HASHTAG/> notbrokedonttryfixit

<NAME/> in West Belfast during the troubles the IRA were despots, but it's convenient for some on the left to forget that - Corbyn one!
And from a centre-right, economically liberal Party. Congratulations! <LINK/>
<NAME/> Libya was quite sympathetic to the IRA too...
<NAME/> so that makes what the IRA did alright does it?
<NAME/> but he doesn't - that's the point. He only talks in generalities, not specifics - because he is tainted with specifics -IRA
And you know better than most Ian - you have lived through it. <LINK/>
<NAME/> the threat of retaliation is what has stopped others doing it to us for the last 70 years. That's what deference is!
And won't even agree that they "killed a lot of people". Can't bring himself to accept the obvious. Weasel words and not fit to be PM
Yet again, in answer to a straight Q he can't bring himself to say that the IRA are terrorists.
Corbyn totally dodges Q if he would use Trident if we were attacked first - audience rightly heckling him. Not fit to protect this country!
Corbyn says his party "is committed to renewing Trident" but then makes clear he would never use it if PM - so what's the point???
<NAME/> first thing is to get the cross-party APPG together again after the election. Working together carries more weight

Trump decision to ditch <HASHTAG/> Parisclimateaccord totally wrong. UK must work with EU, India, China to defend international collaboration on this

Corbyn: calling Hamas "friends" was "inclusive piece of language" - ducks the fact that they murder civilians. Our next PM? Really?

Tonight Theresa May showed she has a clear plan for Britain and is the only person to get the best deal for us in Brexit negotiations <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
More disadvantaged young people going to university under a Conservative government- giving more young people a change to get on in life
Corbyn spent years siding with the IRA and meeting with IRA terrorists at the height of the Troubles. Judge him by his record
Corbyn twice tonight: 'fair point'. He can't answer audience questions and he's not up to the job of PM <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn showing he's just not up to the job. No safe way to vote Labour if you don't want him in charge of our Brexit, economy, security
Corbyn doesn't have the judgement to keep our country safe - don't forget he voted against renewing Trident
Jeremy Corbyn could be Prime Minister in 6 days time and putting our security at risk by dismantling our nuclear defences
Jeremy Corbyn thinks the last Labour government 'spent too little'. He poses a real risk to our growing economy and ordinary families
Corbyn doesn't know how much his policies cost or how he'll pay for them
Labour's corporation tax rises would cost small businesses, investments and jobs <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn and the coalition that would prop him up all oppose our plan to get the right deal with the EU
Corbyn can't negotiate a good deal for Britain and said he would accept any deal the EU offered <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
It's also right that we're looking how to make school funding fairer so some schools aren't getting twice as much as others in the UK
We've protected the schools budget but it's not just about funding, 1.8m more children in good/outstanding schools since 2010
Theresa May showing tonight she has a plan for a stronger Britain and the leadership to deliver it <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

Tonight Corbyn and his coalition of chaos have shown how far they would risk our Brexit, our economy, our security <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
11 days after the election Jeremy Corbyn could be negotiating Brexit, yet he doesn't even mention it once when asked about his leadership
Corbyn can promise anything but we know he can't deliver. 3/4 of Labour MPs don't even think he's up for the job of leading their party
<HASHTAG/> BBCDebate showing exactly why we need strongandstable leadership now and in our crucial Brexit negotiations
This coalition of chaos doesn't have the judgement to keep Britain safe and would put our nation's security at risk
We've invested Â£144m to boost armed police capability  &  given the security  &  intelligence agencies the power to respond to increased threats
Amber Rudd: We will protect the police budget going forward and crime has fallen since 2010
Corbyn has been opposing anti-terror legislation since 1983 and has said 'we should not make value judgments' about people who support ISIS
Brexit negotiations start just 11 days after you vote and Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn will be PM - there's no other choice
The Basic State Pension is up Â£1,250 under the Conservatives
Jeremy Corbyn doesn't even know how much his policies cost <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
The British people would be landed with a tax and debt bombshell under Jeremy Corbynâ€™s chaotic leadership
This is what a coalition of chaos looks like and in just 8 days a loss of only 6 seats would lose Theresa May her majority
Coalition of chaos would mean higher taxes, higher immigration and fewer jobs.
We want to reduce and control immigration as we leave the EU. Jeremy Corbyn does not want to control our borders
Corbynâ€™s tax hikes would cost jobs and investment and lead to more waste, more debt and more uncertainty for British people
Employment is up 2.9m since Labour was in power, a coalition of chaos would bring risk to our growing economy
We have built a safety net for disabled people by increasing spending on disability benefits by more than Â£3 bn in real terms since 2010
Under Labour tax would rise to record peacetime levels says the IFS
Getting the best Brexit deal is central to everything. Corbyn and his coalition of chaos would disrupt these crucial negotiations
The Lib Dems would back Corbyn's inheritance tax rise, support his Garden Tax and would increase income tax
Amber Rudd sets out the choice in just 8 days time. A successful Brexit and strong economy or a coalition of chaos. <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate
Leanne Wood wouldn't rule serving in a Corbyn cabinet: we need strongandstable leadership to get the best Brexit deal <HASHTAG/> BBCDebate

Great to be with <NAME/> today, Theresa May's candidate in Southampton Test. On 8 June vote Conservative to seâ€_ <LINK/>
Vote Conservative on the 8 June: every single vote counts because every single vote will strengthen the PM's hand in Brexit negotiations
PM: No deal is better than a bad deal
Jeremy Corbyn can't commit to reducing immigration. We will get control of our borders as we leave the EU.
Just 11 days after we vote the EU will start Brexit negotiations with Britain. Theresa May has a plan for Brexit and is ready to deliver
The PM will deliver the best Brexit deal for Britain. Jeremy Corbyn constantly FAILS to say we should leave the EU
There are big challenges ahead and we need strongandstable leadership <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
We have protected and increased NHS funding by an extra Â£10 billion and there are more doctors and nurses looking after patients
Just 11 days after we vote the EU will start Brexit negotiations with Britain and Theresa May needs every vote for the best Brexit hand
Jeremy Corbyn would put our growing economy at risk - meaning less money for schools
By putting record investment into our schools and backing teachers, weâ€™ve got 1.8 million more pupils in good and outstanding schools
Getting Brexit right is central to everything - only Theresa May has a plan and can deliver economic security to make the UK even better
We have protected the police budget. Corbyn's team wanted to cut it by 10% <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn makes excuses for everything he's said in the last 35 years. He is weak and nonsensical and would put our nation's future at risk
Corbyn could be Prime Minister in 11 days time but wouldn't take action against ISIS attack planning
Labour doesn't believe we need to control immigration and the last time they were in power immigration increased five-fold
Corbyn doesn't have a plan for Brexit and admits he is prepared to accept literally any deal Europe offers
Corbyn doesn't believe in his own manifesto and can't be trusted with the country's security in 10 days from now
Corbyn voted against renewing Trident and refused to say whether he would renew it as Prime Minister
Corbyn isn't concerned about the level of immigration and says he 'doesn't want to be held' to cutting it
Jeremy Corbyn refused 7 times to say he would definitely go ahead with Brexit. He can't be trusted to negotiate a good deal for Britain
Jeremy Corbyn is denying his past - he has spent years siding with the IRA rather than Britain
Jeremy Corbyn can't be trusted to keep this country safe and has been involved in opposing anti-terror legislation since 1983

Night the leader of the Labour Party and potential U.K. Prime Minister stood in honour of dead IRA terrorists <LINK/>
<NAME/> I shall look forward to Corbyn's visit to Bolton almost as much as May's two visits - for different reasons obvs!
<NAME/> <NAME/> Is that a changed position because he normally wants to sit down, negotiate and meet demands half way?
<NAME/> If the PM were not responsible for national security then it would not be a political question - since the PM is, it is.
As 172 Labour MPs thought Jeremy Corbyn was not good enough to leader their Party he is not good enough to be PM. <LINK/>
The Labour leader refuses to back his own manifesto which plans to spend billions on Trident renewal. <LINK/>

Reforming school funding is essential, Solihull has for years lagged Brum, new proposals will see a 5.2% increase for our secondary schools
Corbyn's affable tone disguises a belief system at odds with national security, he simply can't be trusted to protect UK <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn floundering...not even willing to be open about his hard left views and that of his shadow chancellor such as abolition of MI5
Corbyn fails to understand it isnt Us and Them with business - choke off business with taxes...you destroy the tax base and public services
Corbyn trying to pull biggest confidence trick in British political history pretending that all his promises can be paid for by the top 5%
Corbyn says "taxing more a bit". Numbers don't add up. IFS says that taxes would rise to the highest ever level seen in peacetime.

Clear win for <NAME/> Clear plan for <HASHTAG/> Brexit and beyond. Corbynomics debunked. Stop the <HASHTAG/> CoalitionOfChaos - <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative! <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Once again, Corbyn refuses to condemn IRA. Putting terrorists before decent people. True to form. <HASHTAG/> NeverCorbyn <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbynomics skewered by audience â€“ Labour sums donâ€™t add up + policies wouldnâ€™t work â€“ hitting hardworking people. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Dimbleby: "Do you want to comment on that?" â€_ â€_ No answer from Corbyn to the tough questions. Donâ€™t take the risk. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Jeremy Corbyn canâ€™t even lead his own party on Trident. Heâ€™s all talk. Canâ€™t deal with tough questions. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Jeremy Corbyn simply canâ€™t be trusted to keep Britain safe. Years of siding with the IRA rather than the law-abiding majority. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbynâ€™s hard left, high tax manifesto will hit hard working families up and down the land. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn just lied on small business Corporation Tax plans - rate goes up from 19p to 21p if he becomes PM! <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Corbyn = higher taxes, fewer jobs, more debt. Donâ€™t take the risk. Now misleading Britain on Corporation Tax on <HASHTAG/> BBCQT <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative
Lib Dems, Greens and the SNP have all said that theyâ€™d form a â€œprogressive allianceâ€ù - and Corbyn doesn't rule out <HASHTAG/> CoalitionOfChaos <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
UK can only afford Â£4bn more for schools with strong economy to pay for it. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative for a plan. Labour: just a wishlist. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Â£4bn more for education - and fairer funding - across the country for local schools. Good news for <HASHTAG/> NEH. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative
No <HASHTAG/> MagicMoneyTree â€“ we need a strong economy to fund strong public services â€“ and we wonâ€™t get that with Corbyn. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
Taking big decisions on social care is important for intergenerational fairness - otherwise we pass costs to our children. <HASHTAG/> VoteConservative
<HASHTAG/> BBCQT audience united on one thing - no 2nd referendum - because we need to give the PM the strongest possible hand to get a good deal.
<NAME/> will lead our country in the national interest - negotiating a good <HASHTAG/> Brexit, because it's in UK and EU mutual interest. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT
<HASHTAG/> CoalitionOfChaos would result in the worst possible deal, at the highest possible price. Getting <HASHTAG/> Brexit right is key to everything. <HASHTAG/> BBCQT

Out and about in Fleet, the hot topics have been taxes and the creation of more good jobs for local people.... <LINK/>

Step change in <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10 - <NAME/> and the <NAME/> have a clear Plan for Britain â€“ a plan for <HASHTAG/> BrexitAndBeyond.
Fact: Crime down by 1/3 since 2010. We've supported police and security services - giving them the powers they need too. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Excuse after excuse for every view Corbyn's ever held. He'd be propped up by Lib Dems and SNP. Not a risk worth taking. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn couldn't negotiate his way out of a wet paper bag - let alone <HASHTAG/> Brexit. <HASHTAG/> GE2017 is too important to risk withâ€_ <LINK/>
Interesting programme so far - and itâ€™s clear that Corbyn canâ€™t negotiate a good <HASHTAG/> Brexit deal. He doesn't have any plan. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
'A profound change in our society' says Corbyn. Making us poorer. Making us weaker. That's change I can do without. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn pretends he'd keep us safe. Yet his Shadow Chancellor 'believes in disbanding MI5'! <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn thinks last Labour Govt â€˜spent too littleâ€™ - despite deficit they created. He'd undo the progress we've madâ€_ <LINK/>
He can't lead his own Party - or even his own Shadow Cabinet! How on earth can he lead our country? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Yet again, Corbyn doesn't back Trident. Putting his left-wing lunacy ahead of keeping people safe. That's not leadership. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn tackled by small businessman on his awful tax policies. High taxes = bad for business and bad for jobs. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumberTen
<NAME/> A Labour manifesto? Itâ€™s just a wish list as hereâ€™s no magic money tree to pay for it. A Â£58bn black hole. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10

<NAME/> if Orsett is closed it will be repkaced with new facilities. Newer means better
<NAME/> some schools get more money than others. We are making sure all schools get their fair share
<NAME/> some schools are losing out as we make funding fairer. Thurrock gains. Self defeating for Thurrock Heads to join the campaign
<NAME/> Thurrock schools will benefit by Â£1.4m from changes to the funding formula
I supplied factual figures to <NAME/> to reassure. This noise will mean changes risk being rejected and Thurrock will lose Â£1.5m
<NAME/> last time I looked Govt dished out money to schools. Odd that <NAME/> gives more credibility to NUT estimates
<NAME/> I am Scott. Thank you. We are all still under lockdown xx
Pleased to see National Governors Association backing school funding formula changes.Current formula is unfair to Thurrock <NAME/>

<NAME/> cant agree with you I am afraid but you have made your argument, I have made mine. Thats democracy. Ministers will decide
<NAME/> <NAME/> hgvs use residential roads as ratruns to get to m25  &  avoid j30. New road will reduce that
<NAME/> <NAME/> thurrocks bigger problems are on j30  &  a13 than a282 which is only a problem to us when there is an incident
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> while west thurrock  &  Purfeet choke
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> carrying motor vehicles rather than trains is a different challenge 7miles of emissions underground?
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> the road network needs resilience. expanding capacity at the current location will not achieve that
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> indeed. Will do
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> the last consultation was on routes 1-4  &  did not include A14 which is an engineering nightmare
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> if you have evidence that proves your contention I am happy to review. till then I cannot agree
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> it is stationary traffic that causes pollution so this wont be the outcome with a new crossing
<NAME/> <NAME/> I have said much on air quality. A new crossing will get traffic moving and reduce air pollution in West Thurrock
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I have made my representations to Government against a new junction 29a. Decision soon
<NAME/> no but you did suggest air quality at the current location had not been considered. My point to you is that it has
<NAME/> so Govt not being cavalier about air quality in west Thurrock. Those who continue to resist a new crossing to the East are
<NAME/> think you will find also that the reason why a bridge alongside the current one has fallen from favour is due to air quality
<NAME/> Without more river crossings the air quality around the Dartford crossing will be poor. Need to get on with it.

<NAME/> well said Diane. It is an ugly world online. People do expect us to accept that abuse goes with the job. It is uncivilised
<NAME/> your story is still wrong. The Dubs amendment was passed in May 2016. Stephen  &  I voted for it. Even your figures don't add up
<NAME/> it's on my profile. Twitter is not a medium for casework. I am sure most MPs would agree. Bye Bye
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I am saying twitter is not a great tool for that purpose. Direct contact is better
<NAME/> <NAME/> I have my own twitter filter. Most of the rubbish posted out here deserves to be ignored
<NAME/> <NAME/> The vote you refer to took place in April. The amendment referred to passed in May. I voted for it
<NAME/> <NAME/> the House of Commons did. Another alternative fact in Your Thurrock's piece.
<NAME/> so refugees aren't a real issue? That's lovely. If you read <NAME/> report on this issue you will see how poor it is
We continue to support refugees from Syria. Home Secretary has stopped Calais scheme. No vote taken to scrap Dubs <HASHTAG/> fakenews <NAME/>
<LINK/> much of any accuracy in this piece. Govt still supporting thousands of refugees from camps, just not those in Europe
<NAME/> <NAME/> Labour blocked UKIP from taking the council. Good on them. This is a minority Conservative administration.
<NAME/> <NAME/> there is no coalition Scott. I will have nothing to do with mean-spirited little englanders.

<NAME/> <NAME/> I share your experience. Thurrock's roads are beyond capacity. We need an alternative crossing
<NAME/> I do and a not shy of expressing my view. It won't please everyone all of the time. There is lobbying for the lakeside slips
<NAME/> you are entitled to disagree with me but I am acting in good faith and dont deserve having my motives questioned
<NAME/> when faced with a problem I dont just bury my head in the sand and hope it will go away. Im fighting for the best for Thurrock
<NAME/> I want more spending on our roads so that the traffic gets moving and we arent constantly gridlocked.
<NAME/> I want to build houses so that those growing up here now can afford to buy homes here.
<NAME/> not without new road infrastructure. There will be no green space left in Aveley soon
<NAME/> I am just being honest. We do need to build homes for people to live in. There arent enough.
<NAME/> and by the way you agreed with me that route 4 was a gamechanger. Whats changed?

Most compelling poll I've seen tonight..<HASHTAG/> GE2017 <LINK/>

<NAME/> Damn, should have recognised your writing!
<NAME/> <NAME/> Still doesn't excuse your mistake Joe.!
Oh well, no irony in demonstrating your compassion with a bit of criminal damage..<HASHTAG/> GE2017 <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Well Alun won't be able to reach them I guess...
<NAME/> <NAME/> Naughty Joe. You should know that pay is set and administered by an independent body, nothing to do with Government!
<NAME/> How did they account for the large percentage of the population who wouldn't watch a tv debate if they were paid huge sums!?
<NAME/> Blimey Katy...! It was a light hearted ref to the fact that not everyone is glued to political progs.
Might be worth remembering that most sensible people weren't watching leaders debates tonight...<HASHTAG/> GE2017
<NAME/> And nearly provided a lookalike career for me too.. <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Luckily no one in the world knows what that expression refers to...
<NAME/> I remember the polls reporting Nick Clegg as the most popular leader since Churchill....
<NAME/> Via email? To..?
<NAME/> DM me a number and I will call you! I was with them but we leap frog!
<NAME/> Where are you and I will be able to say what time of day we called. Been 100 miles today! Happy to ring if you want.
<NAME/> Via DM or what?
<NAME/> <NAME/> But, UKIP might retain some Labour 'kippers thus helping Tories where they DO stand...
<NAME/> <NAME/> Of course those are the only two policies on offer. Nothing else at all. Twitter at its best..

That's really cleared things up... <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> I'm sure everyone knows what they are doing...

<NAME/> Because it defies common sense and logic - which is possibly why you think it is completely an unremarkable Jeremy comment!
By anybody's standards that is unbelievable... <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Finding inept and cliched ways of trying to say "I really am normal you know" is an even bigger problem...
<NAME/> what? Why not visit it then? Concept supported by all who gave evidence.

<NAME/> <NAME/> never claimed he was the youngest! I just want to support anyone like him or Mhairi who step up to the mark.
<NAME/> think that's one for <NAME/> to be honest!
<NAME/> opposite to my point? If we want everyone to care, as I do, then nobody should feel diminished if they don't.
<NAME/> but not all read and write in the language. My point is that a heavy duty policy doc maybe one thing, but a calling card isn't.
<NAME/> not sure printing a calling card in one language is cynical. It is a calling card, no more.
<NAME/> I generally don't do bilingual letters, only leaflets.
<NAME/> <NAME/> mainly on issues of S4C funding, borrowing powers and move to Carmarthen. Also resisting attacks on bilingualism.
<NAME/> <NAME/> thank you!
<NAME/> chuffed card is still remembered. You are right tho on that one item. Intended to be some fun/different. Didn't translate well,
<NAME/> really? He's a younger person prepared to stand for public office. All of us, of whatever party, should respect that.
<NAME/> all my election leaflets are bilingual, but I'm glad you read them. And that isnt dependent on S4C move!
Of course not. However ridiculing people like <NAME/> for not speaking the language is no way to make it flourisâ€_ <LINK/>
Wrong! Ask the boss of S4C what I've been doing... <LINK/>

The biggest single cut in Armed Police in Greater Manchester was in 2009 under Labour. A cut of 20%.

It has been a privilege to have been briefed today by the men  &  women of Greater Manchester Police on the terrorist attack last night.
In light of the attack in Manchester tonight please be vigilant  &  if you see anything suspicious call the anti-terrorist hotline 0800789321
My thoughts are with all the victims of the incident tonight  &  our emergency services who are out there tending wounded  &  keeping us safe
<NAME/> <NAME/> Because some wanted to use force not democracy to change the constitutional settlement
<NAME/> <NAME/> He did not condemn the IRA and he equates them to the British Army
<NAME/> Keep kidding yourself on! Better for you that way I think!
<NAME/> No.9 is pure fantasy of deluded, excuse making terrorist sympathisers. The IRA didn't come to the peace table because of Corbyn.

We have seen it. It's called PMQs. You're not that good at it Mr Corbyn <LINK/>
Richard: I'm incredibly proud to be the Conservative Party Candidate for North Dorset. I've never supported or fliâ€_ <LINK/>
Jess: are you surprised? They're Lib Dems after all: not v liberal, not v democratic and not clean campaigners <LINK/>
Richard: you call them the mob; I call them the electorate. Perhaps explains why Greens are not v popular? <LINK/>
James: not a u turn. The PM and I are democrats. We trust the People. <LINK/>
It's the unfailing optimism of the Left that always floats my boat <LINK/>
James, my v good friend, you're irony is shining through. Keep giving Corbyn hell <LINK/>
Corbyn still thinks it's 1977/78 and he's Woolfie Smith leading the Tooting Popular Front! <LINK/>
May Heaven help us all! <LINK/>
'Can we come back to that one?'. It's not a pub quiz! Same old labour: it's tax payers' Â£ so what does it matter <LINK/>
He simply can't become PM <HASHTAG/> toomuchbaggage <LINK/>
Surely it's worrying when an aspirant Home Sec can't tell difference , in values terms, between a coiffure and murdering IRA terrorists?

Budget: Coverage, including my comments, reported by <HASHTAG/> ndevon Gazette: <LINK/>
This is a good overview. <LINK/>
The Chancellor sits down after an hour. Lots to welcome, esp. funding for social care, but need to examine details as regards <HASHTAG/> ndevon
Will announce multi-year funding for NHS in Autumn. But more money immediately for some areas inc extra for A & E. Good. Need to see details.
Additional funding of Â£2bn for social care in England in next 3 years; Â£1bn immediately. Plus extra in some areas. Plus big review later.
CofEx announces Â£260 million more for schools next year. Welcome, but need to see how that will be shared out.
Extra funding to develop driver-less technologies, "Something the Labour Party knows a great deal about".
National Living Wage up in April, personal allowance up too. Together means 29m people better off, average taxpayer by Â£1k since 2010.
No further changes to duties on alcohol, tobacco, etc. beyond those previously announced.
Business Rates: cap on increases, Â£1k discount for most pubs; local councils get Â£300m for discretionary relief. Chancellor has listened.
"This is the spreadsheet bit" says CofEx, before announcing UK economy forecast to grow 2% next year, up from 1.4%, plus more employment.
In House of Commons now preparing for PMQs  &  then the Budget. Will Tweet initial thoughts as we go. <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <HASHTAG/> ndevon

<NAME/> My son is 10 months-old so his rousing speech might have been slightly different!
<NAME/> Thanks Daniel. That means a lot coming from you.
It's quite possible to be standing as <NAME/> opponent for <HASHTAG/> BradfordWest and still think this is a lovely momâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> Thank you Jane! This means a great deal.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Sure, but that doesn't automatically impact the proportion oâ€_ <LINK/>
Calling all voters in <HASHTAG/> BradfordWest! Get in touch, ask any question and join the debate at <LINK/> <HASHTAG/> GE2017
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Agreed. Slightly misleading figures showing an 18% swing TOâ€_ <LINK/>
I will endeavour not to disappoint. But it's always important to have at least one George on the ballot paper in Brâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> Great. But good luck trying to predict which way those ex-Galloway supporters will go. Bradford Westâ€_ <LINK/>
Ready for the hustings when you are... <NAME/>
<NAME/> Your prediction for Bradford West includes a 21% vote for a George Galloway equivalent. Interested iâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> If we can get a good deal to give us maximum access then brilliant. I'm also very much in favour oâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> Cannot be EEA as that includes the "Four Freedoms". Brexit means leaving the EU. All of it. 1/2
<NAME/> As you say I voted Remain but now we are heading out. I do not believe in this hard/soft Brexit distinction.
Well, it's back to the future folks: I'm pleased to announce I'm once more standing as the <HASHTAG/> GE2017 Conservative candidate for Bradford West.
<NAME/> pretty dramatic result out of Queensbury last night. I wonder how that affects your assessment for Bradford South at GE2017?
The <NAME/> did more than that. They took the majority from 5 to 1,443, with a swing of 18.5%. <NAME/> <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Definitely yes.
Just the sort of opinion out of Europe that is guaranteed to reduce UK hostility to EU and ensure <HASHTAG/> Brexit a ringingâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> That's very kind. Not sure yet. We will see.
Extremely promising result for the Conservatives in the Bradford South ward of Queensbury, where the majority has risen to 1,443... from 5.
It's only when political obsessives want to end it all they've heard a slogan so often that it's JUST starting to câ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> that the Conservatives are every bit as much working for the interests of the majority as Labour, and frankly more so.
<NAME/> I believe that in terms of generating a favourable economic climate in this country, which is the most suâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> I don't think the Conservatives do do that obviously. If I did, and I mean this, I would resign my membership tomorrow.
<NAME/> Perhaps lots of people just don't trust Corbyn on major issues that don't directly affect their daily lives. 2/2
<NAME/> There's an irony here. Isn't it an oft-said principle on the Left that people should vote for reasons othâ€_ <LINK/>
Oh the irony. She's right about <HASHTAG/> forthemanynotthefew of course, it's just that she's got it all wrong on which of tâ€_ <LINK/>
May the 4th be with him. <LINK/>
<NAME/> The same psychological principles apply during the referendum and in the negotiations afterwards.
The lesson of the Scottish referendum was the more you bully  &  cajole, the more you harden opinion against you. Brussels take note. <HASHTAG/> Brexit
<NAME/> Haha! Definitely the second one. Unofficial advice of course...
I've decided to hire my own security detail. I've run the numbers past Diane Abbott  &  she tells me 10 police officers will cost Â£5.77 a week
Thanks for the follow <NAME/> and, if I do stand, thank you for your prayers. Pls pray for wisdom and grace especially.

80% Labour MPs don't support <HASHTAG/> Corbyn. How can you lead a country if you can't even lead your own party? <LINK/>

There has never been an MP called Amy. There were 18 MPs called John ( &  7 called Michael) in the last Parliament. <LINK/>
I'm afraid I'm not able to respond individually - balancing work  &  campaigning is tough!

Only just tuned in to <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10 to find that <HASHTAG/> Corbyn doesn't seem to be answering any of Paxo's questions
<NAME/> Not so - this is from our manifesto <LINK/>
<NAME/> Corbyn didn't want compromise. He wanted the terrorists to win
But when, aged 6, an IRA bomb threat stops you going to school, your views on terrorism remain pretty set.
A lot of people seem interested in my hairstyle today. It's changed occasionally over the years.
<NAME/> has it right: Corbyn never seems to have met an enemy of our country he didn't like. He is not fitâ€_ <LINK/>

To my mind, anyone who backed the IRA is not fit to join the government of this country.
I lived in N Ireland as a kid  &  remember not being able to go to school bc of bomb threats. It was a scary time.

Delighted with so much in our manifesto - looking forward to talking to people about it on the doorstep this weekend <LINK/>

<NAME/> <NAME/> I am reporting it right now - couldn't get through on 101 so doing it online
I have a scratch on my face but am otherwise fine. Just: don't have your phone in your hand.
There was no licence plate on the moped. The guy's face was obscured by a scarf under his helmet. Am heading home to report it online
He shouted at me "you walked into me". That was a lie. He tried to steal my phone from my hand. He legged it onto the back of a moped
I screamed vv loudly  &  wrested it back off him. Ppl nearby came to my aid  &  with ppl around he backed off.
Scary thing happened just now. Was walking down Blurton Rd, E5 while talking on my phone. Man in a motorbike helmet tried to grab it

<NAME/> <NAME/> a bit premature this analysis seems! Or out of date!!

<NAME/> where did you see it announced as a main stage policy? Wasn't in the speech and Rudd denied it was next day on Radio 4....
<NAME/> This was your report idea from last conference! <LINK/>
<NAME/> nope.
<NAME/> Neither. They've decided that the "Tory scum" are MPs in the Labour party, so they did all their chanting last week.
<NAME/> IIRC, we all had people shouting and spitting at us as we walked in. They weren't Tories though, were they?

<NAME/> <NAME/> you're mixing James up with Suzanne Evans.
<NAME/> I completely agree. It is now excessive. Obviously not all police are perfect, but the demonisation needs to stop.
<NAME/> <NAME/> some excellent points, Gavin. I like suggestion for met to provide more public info. Will push for that with assembly.
I wonder if <NAME/> has any black writers? Pretty sure <NAME/> could teach them a thing or two about diversity! (3/3)

<NAME/> but I sense some trepidation too, no? We live in interesting times _Ÿ˜€

<NAME/> Tory AMs would disagree. Post-Wheatcroft brought in much needed transparency. And any actions by previous mayor not a reason...

<NAME/> I tried to do so at some length in this article last year - no cut through yet I fear <LINK/>
<NAME/> Why is this important? I'm sure Attlee's (Tory Peer) grandson differs with many of his grandfather's admirers too
<NAME/> "I just conform to my surroundings, while others develop considered philosophical positions. I'm the independent-minded one."
<NAME/> ... they generalise about all Presidents based on one side and then use that position to oppose engaging with the other side!
<NAME/> So many who say US Presidents don't care much about the UK should really say *Democrat* Presidents don't much care. Instead...
<NAME/> Important to counter, as you did, the underreporting here in the UK of how much more pro-British the GOP is than the Democrats
<NAME/> My dictionary defines 'Militant' as yelling at Audrey Lewis at length for bringing her vicar along to the Mayor-making.
<NAME/> What is your view of state faith schools?
<NAME/> 'Tis indeed extreme. It's also wrong as explained in the article: it's taxpayers' money not yours and religious liberty matters
<NAME/> <NAME/> ... use the language of neutral, passive secularism while in practice being actively anti-religious liberty.
<NAME/> ... wants to ban religious schools, ban crosses from the work place and so on. Some people do even if you don't and they ...
<NAME/> It sounds like you are distancing yourself from militant secularism, which is great. But your speech seemed to imply no one ...
<NAME/> Is banning clothes a neutral position on clothing? If not, why is banning religious schools a neutral position on religion?
<NAME/> Being anti-religious schools is not a neutral position by definition. Simply labelling it secularism doesn't change that.
<NAME/> I did listen. Article responds to the idea secularism is some kind of unobjectionable neutrality rather than a belief system.
<NAME/> It suggests that if you go after religious schools or employees wearing crosses you'll disproportionately hurt Londoners.
<NAME/> By the way, London is the most religious part of the UK, and has the fewest atheists, for what that is worth.
<NAME/> I wrote this years ago but I think it's also a good response to your speech on Wed. You may not agree! <LINK/>

Wow - just wow. <LINK/>
<NAME/> is right, as usual <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> See my article today: <LINK/> (Nearly all those in prison have already been thru com rehab, btw)
<NAME/> <NAME/> It's a disgrace how anti-prison campaigners have spread this lie that lots of petty offenders go to prison.
<NAME/> <NAME/> crime has fallen as more and more serious and repeat offenders have gone to prison.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Theoretically, because someone can't threaten wider public from a prison cell. Empirically, because all data shows
<NAME/> <NAME/> than 85k serious, repeat offenders but we only have 85k prison cells.
<NAME/> <NAME/> to prison - and tens of thousands of serious, repeat offenders DON'T go to prison. We have far more ...
<NAME/> <NAME/> I am sure you believe this to be true, but it's complete nonsense. Almost no low risk petty offenders go ...
<NAME/> <NAME/> If you had a lot fewer than 85k people committing enough offences to merit prison, I'd argue for fewer not more.
<NAME/> <NAME/> In itself, no - the higher prison population is purely to ensure the right prison capacity.
<NAME/> immune from that effect.
<NAME/> misrepresenting the data on sentencing and so on and their dishonest arguments influence the entire wider debate. No party is
<NAME/> I'd add that there is a massive, well-funded mini-industry of anti-prison campaigner who are shameless about deliberately ...
<NAME/> I'd add that even if I am wrong about the Tory party it doesn't make me wrong about sentencing etc.
<NAME/> it is down to unfamiliarity with solid data that can be remedied.
<NAME/> I don't share in your analysis of the party. I think insofar as any Tory disagrees with what I've said earlier (and most don't)
<NAME/> You have more confidence in deterrent effect, I have more in incarceration effect but we both believe in both.
<NAME/> I do feel we're very much on same page though - prisons and policing sld be tougher and we need prison capacity for that
<NAME/> There is a LOT of space for longer sentences before you risk being too harsh/unfair to criminals.
<NAME/> You can have much longer but limited sentences. You're currently more likely to be cautioned than serve 3 years for burglary
<NAME/> Sounds good to me! Just as long as we can keep them locked up if deterrent fails for some of them.
<NAME/> a prison cell for as long as they are a threat to the public. Doubling down on deterring the few who go to prison insufficient
<NAME/> It is true even without a deterrent effect. You can deter some but not all criminals. For those you can't deter, you need...
<NAME/> it only lasts as long as you take the warfarin. Keep taking the warfarin/locking up serious criminals then!
<NAME/> Such arguments support more use of prison, not less. It's like saying don't take warfarin for a heart condition because ...
<NAME/> locking someone up for x months/years if they emerge unreformed. Even if that prevented thousands of crimes in the interim.
<NAME/> Also very dangerous to dismiss incarceration effect because criminal undeterred. That is exactly what liberals do - dismiss
<NAME/> I definitely support much tougher prisons and have been quoted in the press saying so - often. But capacity matters most.
<NAME/> I think Tory Party is best vehicle for much higher prison population. I agree it failed on crime in 1980s
<NAME/> If most criminals had an IQ above 110 then the deterrent effect would work much better.
<NAME/> That's the opposite of my point. I say we need prisons for crims simply too thick to be deterred (which is a lot of them).
<NAME/> a long unpleasant prison stretch won't work that well - especially if you don't have the prison cells anyway.
<NAME/> is to burgle houses and mug an attack people. Relying on them being deterred by some far off prospect of ...
<NAME/> All of us struggle to avoid temptation, especially those with low IQs. Key is too keep locked up those whose temptation ...
<NAME/> All I'm saying is we need the prison capacity for that.
<NAME/> Taking a prolific crim out of circulation a few months can prevent hundreds of crimes. But absolutly it should be years/decades
<NAME/> who are too low IQ to deter or educate (which is a large number). Key is to keep them locked up for their crime prone years
<NAME/> Multiply that by tens of thousands of offenders and you start to make decent people's lives much better, even with crims ...
<NAME/> I think a few years at least. But someone who commits 600 burglaries in three months can't do that for three months from a cell
<NAME/> 10k more prison places costs Â£130m a year - or 0.1% of annual govt spend
<NAME/> would otherwise fall victim to those people.
<NAME/> Even an extra 10k more serious, repeat offenders in prison each year would make a big impact on thousands of people who ....
<NAME/> I don't have the figures to hand but in a period of 19th century we built massive prison capacity very quickly.
<NAME/> mean anything other than much more crime.
<NAME/> Much truth in that. But we need to be a far more socially conservative society again before a low prison population will ...
<NAME/> a year, often hundreds of offences a year. You're arguing against basic mathematics, aren't you?
<NAME/> Locking up 40k more hardened criminals a year achieves nothing? Each one of them would otherwise commit dozens of offences ...
<NAME/> lock up more people early on in their criminal careers would.
<NAME/> there are far more serious, repeat offenders than prison cells doesn't help. Building enough prison places so that you can ...
<NAME/> likely a hardened, prolific criminal. Big answer to that is more prison places. Simply making existing capacity tougher when...
<NAME/> I am paying attention and I agree - far too difficult to get into prison and by the time someone gets there they are ...
<NAME/> I am all for tougher prisons but being tougher on 85k rather than jailing 200k seems a red herring
<NAME/> I'm sure it has some effect but that effect is dwarfed by the simple fact you can't threaten wider society from a prison cell
<NAME/> Definirely - which is one reason incarceration helps so much. Once they are out of prison, can take a long time to catch them.
<NAME/> All of those offences are included in police recorded crime, which show the same massive falls since prison population doubled
<NAME/> That was true prior to 1995, though - so it doesn't explain the massive decline since then
<NAME/> Are you saying it's a coincidence that CSEW crime figures have fallen 2/3 as prison population has doubled?
<NAME/> I'm not against much tougher prisons but people with an average IQ in the low 90s hard to deter full stop. Incarceration is key
<NAME/> Punitive wld help but most crims have too low an IQ to be deterred by prison conditions - main effect is keeping them locked up
<NAME/> It has problems but I find it far fetched that those problems suddenly emerged in 1995 just as the prison population rocketed
<NAME/> be huge for public safety. No reason to deny that. Labour now wants sentencing of 1995 - which would mean 1995 crime rates
<NAME/> I agree with you on PACE and I'd like to see more prisons - but difference between 47k and 95k a year going to prison would ...

<NAME/> The article's author seems oblivious to any of the explanations offered by evolutionary psychology
<NAME/> And not even true. Cuba was one of the healthiest countries in the world pre-Castro and has declined massively since.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> So basically Hove  &  Sunderland used to look like Pall Mall pre the socialists ...
<NAME/> My *GUESS* is they are using their own definition of swing: 78% of 2015 C voters still vote C while the other 22% vote Lab
<NAME/> Yeah, I think Lab needs a 1997 style swing (ie around 10%) for a majority, which is indeed very big. But not a 22% swing!
<NAME/> Works fine for me, though slowly - but the numbers are way off. E.g. Lab in 1997 had a lead a third as large - 12 points.
<NAME/> <LINK/>
<NAME/> There's something seriously wrong with it. It says a 22% C to Lab swing (ie a 37pt Lab lead!) = >  a Labour majority of 1.

The Brexit negotiations look set to start 11 days after the election. Don't risk Corbyn in charge of Brexit.â€_ <LINK/>
Nobody who saw that <HASHTAG/> bbcqt could ever want to entrust Corbyn with our defence, security, economy or <HASHTAG/> Brexit
Protracted, slow-motion car crash <HASHTAG/> Corbyn <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Left wing element of audience has fallen silent. They know Corbyn has flopped. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
This audience has rumbled Corbyn: weak on defence, weak on security. He'd be a disaster for this country. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
In no circumstances will Corbyn ever condemn the IRA. Ever. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Of course Corbyn doesn't want flexible employment; that's because he's a Marxist <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
This audience has comprehensively demolished Corbyn <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn's abysmal replies on defence have put him off his stroke. He looks utterly lost. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn has just demonstrated precisely why he must never be entrusted with the defence of our country <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn displays the thought processes of David Brent <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Full of waffle: Corbyn never uses one word when ten will do <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Heaven help us if this man ever had to negotiate our departure from the EU <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Audience member succinctly points out that Labour always crash the economy: "There's no money left." <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Same business owner points out that Labour's tax plans would destroy jobs <HASHTAG/> Bbcqt
Small business owner concerned about Labour's economic plans; probably millions more share his concerns <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
That's the point. We can't trust Corbyn and his peers to negotiate <HASHTAG/> Brexit. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM commits to diversity within the education system; unfortunate that WG won't do likewise in Wales <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
The only way the NHS can receive proper funding is if there is a strong economy to support it <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM right about Diane Abbott: who would want her to be responsible for our national security? <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
PM quite right: Labour would accept any <HASHTAG/> Brexit deal, even if not in the best interests of the country <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

As North Korea tests another missile, do we really want a Prime Minister with a complete lack of resolve over the nuclear deterrent?
In summary: PM was quite prepared to defend her record. Corbyn spent most of his time trying to deny his. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
PM reiterates that no deal is better than a bad deal: "I'm not prepared to sign up to a bad deal for the UK." A strong finish.
Should a potential Prime Minister really use "inclusive language" when referring to terrorists of Hamas and Hizbollah? <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn currently denying everything he's ever said he believes in. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Paxman immediately seizes on Corbyn's incoherence on defence. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
It was a simple question to Corbyn: "Would you use the nuclear deterrent?" No answer.

More borrowing, more taxes, weakened defences, softness on terrorism. That's what you'd get with Jeremy Corbyn. <HASHTAG/> GE2017 <HASHTAG/> BBCelection
Corbyn seriously doesn't appear to understand that issuing a bond is a form of borrowing. Seriously. <HASHTAG/> BBCElection <HASHTAG/> GE2017
Of course Corbyn doesn't support the renewal of Trident. Why can't he just say so?
Corbyn rightly taken to task by <NAME/> for his, McDonnell's and Abbott's IRA sympathies. <HASHTAG/> GE2017

The only way you can help avoid a Labour led government, led by Miliband  &  propped up by Alex Salmond is by voting Conservative tomorrow.
A vote for UKIP tomorrow in Gedling is a vote which will help Labour, and which will help see Ed Miliband get into Downing Street
Tomorrow, a vote for the Conservatives is a vote for a strong economy, which brings with it a secure future. <LINK/>

Theresa May has a plan to secure the best deal from Brexit to control our laws, borders and money-donâ€™t risk Corbyn whoâ€™s not up to the job
In an age of shock election results thereâ€™s a real risk Corbyn could end up in No.10 in charge of Brexit UNLESS you vote for Theresa May
Corbyn isnâ€™t equipped to negotiate Brexit keep our economy strong or our nation secure thereâ€™s no safe way to vote Labourâ€“wherever you live.
11 days after YOU vote, the EU want to start Brexit negotiations. Who negotiates for Britain is up to you: Theresa May or Corbyn <HASHTAG/> Halifax

My 3 point plan for <HASHTAG/> Halifax <HASHTAG/> GE2017 <HASHTAG/> Conservatives <LINK/>
Choice at this election clear.Theresa May protecting our national interest  &  keeping us safe VS Jeremy Corbyn who simply isnt up to the job.
Jeremy Corbyn has a long track record of siding with Britainâ€™s enemies. Not up to the job of being PM and keeping our country safe. <HASHTAG/> Halifax
Jeremy Corbyn has boasted about opposing all anti-terror laws since 1983. Not up to the job of keeping our country safe. <HASHTAG/> Halifax
Corbyn said in 2014 we shouldn't â€˜make value judgementsâ€™ about ppl attracted to ISIS. VOTE to stop him becoming PM in 2 weeksâ€™ time <HASHTAG/> Halifax
Corbyn said in 2014 that tolerating support for ISISâ€˜quite important in a democracyâ€™.Not up to the job of keeping our country safe. <HASHTAG/> Halifax
NO excuses for what was done in Manchester. Corbyn is not up to the job of keeping our country safe. <HASHTAG/> Halifax
There is never an excuse for terrorism. Jeremy Corbyn has shown today why he is not up to the job of keeping our country safe. <HASHTAG/> Halifax
<NAME/> say Corbyn would raise taxes to RECORD peacetime levels. Only Theresa Mayâ€™s team will protect the economy  &  jobs through Brexit
<NAME/> say that Jeremy Corbynâ€™s manifesto is gambling with youth unemployment and peopleâ€™s pension pots
Corbyn  &  John McDonnellâ€™s plans to increase Corp Tax will mean lower wages say <NAME/>
Corbynâ€™s Manifesto promised to raise Â£49bn through tax but <NAME/> say theyâ€™d raise less than this â€“ Corbynâ€™s sums donâ€™t add up
<NAME/> say Jeremy Corbynâ€™s tax hikes wouldnâ€™t hit the top 5% they would hit ordinary working families in the pocket
<NAME/> say Corbynâ€™s Manifesto would increase spending  &  have a much bigger deficit â€“ hitting ordinary working families
<NAME/> say Jeremy Corbyn would RAISE tax to record peacetime levels and preside over a â€˜much biggerâ€™ deficit â€“ his sums donâ€™t add up

<HASHTAG/> Conservatives will not rest until the benefits of a strong economy are felt in every community, in every part of our United Kingdom.
2/2 We need to keep going with our Plan for Britain, ensuring our economy remains strong. <HASHTAG/> Conservatives
1/2 BUT, there is more still to do â€“ which is why weâ€™re creating a welfare system that rewards work and ensures that it always pays to work.
2/2 Itâ€™s happened because <HASHTAG/> Conservatives have taken the difficult decisions to turn our economy around and get people into work.
1/2 There are a record number of people now in Britain earning a wage  &  providing for their families. None of this has happened by accident.
So, todayâ€™s record-breaking figures show unemployment falling to its lowest level since 2005. <HASHTAG/> Conservatives
Since <HASHTAG/> Conservatives entered government, employment is up by over 2.8 million, over 1,000 more people in work on average every day.
According to todayâ€™s figures, the unemployment rate remains at 4.7% - a rate that hasnâ€™t been beaten since the 1970s. <HASHTAG/> Conservatives
The top 1% of Income taxpayers pay 27.5% of all Income Tax  &  the top 25% now pay 75% of all Income tax paid. 44% now pay ZERO Income Tax.

Will be lost in flurry of announcements, but I for one would like to pay tribute to <NAME/> for all he did - for country and party.
<NAME/> well quite. Modernisation should be a permanent state of affairs.
In 2005, the Conservatives were a broken electoral force. Now, its hard to imagine another party in Government. Cameron's legacy.
Today, more than ever, the choice for the next Prime Minister is clear: <NAME/> <HASHTAG/> TM4PM
Only one serious candidate for Prime Minister, with the experience we need right now: <NAME/> <HASHTAG/> TM4PM
Clear that <NAME/> is the Prime Minister we need right now. A serious politician for serious times <HASHTAG/> TM4PM.
<NAME/> if push came to shove, as per the French offer, would you prefer immigration controls or passporting for financial services?
<NAME/> Civility and debate is very important. In your opinion, what's more important, passporting for the city or migration curbs?
<NAME/> you don't think people viewed 'making decisions in UK' as overarching priority, but saw as a mandate for reduced immigration?
<NAME/> why can't 'decisions made in the UK' still refer to immigration?
<NAME/> what would you like to see Stewart? I presume you have a view?
<NAME/> surely that relies on article 50 ever being invoked. EEA + model doesn't require it?
<NAME/> EEA, free movement with emergency break? Sort of Liechtenstein + . Less economically risky  &  PM would have 'control'...
We had this referendum because David Cameron tried to placate his supporters, we lost it because Labour never did.

The real problem with the long queues into the conference is the parallel line of protesters yelling abuse: <LINK/>
My advice to anyone at <HASHTAG/> CPC do not 'quickly pop out' of the secure zone. <LINK/>
Many peaceful protesters in Manchester today, but crowds currently outside Conservative conference are just there to bully and intimidate.
Steve Rotherham now Corbyn's PPS - used his 2015 acceptance speech to denounce wicked, evil  &  disgusting Tories. A kinder gentler politics?
<NAME/> you could be right. I mean all avaliable electoral  &  international evidence suggests you aren't, but feel free to chance it.

Great questions, engaged students and Mr Etheridge as energetic as ever. <NAME/>  &  <NAME/> at its best. <LINK/>

Labour haven't won an election without Tony Blair since 1974, yet amazingly with MPs and members he remains more toxic than Jeremy Corbyn.

So, it turns out Farage didn't resign. UKIP just a cult of personality sewn together by internal stitch-ups: <LINK/>
No Dan Jarvis, no Chuka. Len McCluskey will be a happy man. Clears the way for Burnham, Cooper and more of the same.

I mean, I've always doubted Farage's credibility, its just nice to see that he now recognises it too.

<NAME/> hard luck Dan, you ran a great campaign and had my vote.
Genuine question: what is the point of UKIP now? Majority Conservative Government will deliver EU referendum, UKIP just background noise.

Congratulations to <NAME/> for yet another increase in his majority. Great local MP.
Well done to <NAME/> for his record breaking result. Keeping Harlow blue!

<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Not a discussion for 140 characters I'm sure you agree.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I do not accuse people of not expressing their own views. People who do tend to have lost the argument.
<NAME/> I think the Prime Minister said in a few words what we all feel.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> College of Policing's plan is going out to consultation, and pilots will provide evidence to examine!
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Or we could look objectively at all the arguments before rejecting them.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Its all about getting the implementation right - and learning lessons from other public services.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Experience plus knowledge equals wisdom.
<NAME/> <NAME/> I recall the same arguments were used about professionalising nursing. It depends on how the changes are introduced.
<HASHTAG/> Victorialive The growing complexity of policing creates the need for new practical professional qualifications and recognition.
Understanding more about cyber crime is the key to keeping safer from it. <LINK/>

Good to see the upgraded listing on the war memorial. Maidstone's proud military heritage deserves recognition. <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Yes, recorded, offenders caught and successfully prosecuted. Care to comment on percentage of solved crimes in Kent?

Great to see new PCC Candidate out and about. Community engagement is the key to the job! Well done Alison. <LINK/>
It's important to get it right. Pleased that the views of PCCs and Chief Constables will be taken into account. <LINK/>

Honoured to attend Sevenoaks Town Council parade and Remembrance service earlier today. <LINK/>

A major step towards stopping this abominable practice. <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Consider the future cost of not tackling problems earlier. I want to look at this in the context of crime prevention.
<NAME/> <NAME/> I am not only aware - I am one of those affected so I have every sympathy with the campaign.
<NAME/> <NAME/> That's why we need a clear matix for SROI. The fact something is difficult to do shouldn't stop us from doing it!
<NAME/> <NAME/> agree with you Emma. Shameful to use Remembrance Parade policing to score cheap political points - !
Well deserved recognition. Rogue traders who target the elderly and vulnerable are utterly without conscience. <LINK/>
<NAME/> I thought this attitude was a thing of the past. It should be!
<NAME/> Thanks for the good wishes, Bill. What our campaign lacked in quantity it made up for in quality :)

Just stood down as Holborn & StPancras Tories Chairman. A great Association with a great team. <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/>
The SNP said the 2014 indyref was a 'once in a generation' vote. Apparently a generation only lasts 4 years...
A Scottish vote to leave the UK at the same time the UK is leaving the EU is a recipe for chaos. It cannot be in anyone's interests.
Whatever your view of Brexit, Sturgeon and the SNP are using it to sow division and pursue their ideological obsession with independence.
Great evening with <NAME/> talking to Holborn  &  St Pancras Conservatives. <NAME/> <LINK/>

Orlando hospitals to waive all medical bills for those injured or killed in Orlando shooting. Many werent insured. A fantastic decision.

Holborn  &  St Pancras Labour <NAME/> nominate Corbyn by a huge margin. Shocker. As out of touch as ever.
<NAME/> hmm. Well hopefully they'll be out-voted by Madison and other cities in Wisconsin!
<NAME/> the number of political posters is never a good indication of how an area will vote. So don't panic just yet!
Shocked by attack on innocent people in Russell Sq last night. Thoughts with all those affected.
Spoke too soon. <NAME/> is appealing the judgement. Disgraceful
Glad the High Court has seen sense on PrEP. Now <NAME/> needs to stop dragging its heals and commission this essential treatment.

I know Owen Smith has to appeal to the Lab membership, but the policies he's proposed today are so left wing they would make Corbyn blush!

'Nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it'. Moving words from <NAME/> in his last PMQs. Thanks DC - you're a class act.
Wtf is Owen Smith thinking by standing for Labour leader? If they have any hope of beating Corbyn they need ONE candidate to oppose him!
Why is Corbyn allowed to attend the NEC meeting thats deciding his future? He just wants to make it extra awkward for anyone who opposes him
Theresa May to be PM by Weds evening. She'll be great. But I will be v sad to see <NAME/> go.

The people have spoken and its time to come together  &  implement their decision. I'm v sorry to see <NAME/> go, he's been a great PM.
Words fail me. RIP <NAME/> - this was a horrific crime and whoever is responsible should face the full force of the law.

God I hate going to the dentist!
<NAME/> this is an appalling post. How can you possibly equate Theresa May to Nazi Germany?
Corbyn "will decide on the circumstances at the time" for nuclear weapons use. It doesn't work like that. You write letters! <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

Corbyn just said Ken Livingstone may NOT face further investigation after election into his anti-Semitism <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Shocking that Ken Livingstone still a Labour Party member. Corbyn can't control anti-Semitism in his party. <HASHTAG/> bbcqt
Corbyn: we are not "looking" for deals. Sounds like door open to coalition of chaos <HASHTAG/> bbcqt

Only <NAME/> actually wants to cut immigration. Jeremy Corbyn wouldn't say it would fall <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
I worked for Vote Leave  &  campaigned for Brexit, I've got no doubt <NAME/> is only person who can deliver the result <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Really good, clear answers from <NAME/> - politics is about making difficult decisions in national interest. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Why does Corbyn always seem to be using "inclusive" language with terrorist groups? Won't clearly condemn what they do <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn still thinks killing Osama Bin Laden was a "tragedy". Every vote for his candidates takes him closer to Downing St<HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn won't even defend British action to recover the Falklands. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Striking that <NAME/> won't and can't commit to cutting immigration. <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Round of applause when Paxman holds <NAME/> to account for his Shadow Chancellor's backing for disbanding MI5 <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn doesn't want to be "held"' to reducing immigration numbers <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Terrifying that if Conservatives lose just 6seats <NAME/> could be PM. He doesn't even have support of his own MPs <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Corbyn's foreign policy answer leaves me totally confused about what he actually wants to do <HASHTAG/> BattleForNumber10
Last few doors to knock on tonight. Several people have raised profound concerns about <NAME/> and <NAME/> today.

<NAME/> <NAME/> ... and a former Labour agent openly supporting us for the GE!...
<NAME/> Cheers! Fingers crossed
<NAME/> Hi Mark - talking to colleagues in the party and will know what's what soon
<NAME/> Absolutely - see the STP appendix. Small saving from acute reconfiguration. Core issue is too few doctors to fill safe rota.
Corbyn sells out over nuclear power. What happened to the new politics? A decent and humble man would step down, noâ€_ <LINK/>
<NAME/> still looking?
<NAME/> <NAME/> Standard. When consultancies cock up like that, they get 'kicked out'. Same in public and private sector.
IDS speaks sense: undo the Universal Credit cuts, make working more worth the effort, and peg pensions to earnings, not 2.5% <HASHTAG/> bbcsp
<NAME/> That still is from him cheering at the biggest increase in the minimum wage since its introduction...
I think we've reached peak <NAME/> <LINK/>
<NAME/> Like Bishop Auckland General Hospital - cost Â£67m to build but annual PFI interest costs alone are ~Â£13m!...
<NAME/> So what these plans do is turn a shortfall into a plan which makes people better and costs less money than before
<NAME/> So even after Â£8bn more cash the NHS needs to change and make people better more efficiently else it'll have a shortfall
<NAME/> ...who will need healthcare services more. Also expensive new treatments drive up costs, etc
<NAME/> So it's referring to different things. Government is spending Â£8bn more on NHS by 2020/21. But we have an ageing population...
<NAME/> Last page here; budget up from Â£92bn to Â£108bn by 2020/21 <LINK/>
Really <NAME/> Labour's spending plans for NHS were lower than Tories' - you pledged a Â£6bn black hole!
Lies from <NAME/> and other Labourites today. NHS budget up by Â£8 billion by 2020. Labour pledged far less. <LINK/>
<NAME/> No it's not. Â£8 billion extra spend each year, as the leaked plans clearly state.
<NAME/> STP plan guarantees improved levels of care with a different configuration of services. Two very different things.
<NAME/> Worse than the St Anger snare?

Excellent speech from Margaret Beckett. Tell those in Kobane, Sierra Leone, Kosovo that air strikes won't work. <HASHTAG/> SyriaVote
<NAME/> <NAME/> ...(3) Close off Turkish border to ISIL
<NAME/> <NAME/> (1) Destroy all known ISIL training facilities. (2) Disable supply routes between Raqqa and Mosul...
<NAME/> <NAME/> No, it's not. But some simply objectives in this imperfect war haven't been laid out. e.g....
<NAME/> <NAME/> I'd vote yes, but with unease. Post-Libya, it's reasonable to want to know where we'll strike, to support whom.
<NAME/> <NAME/> What's the plan in areas where it's ISIL vs. Assad? Are we striking ISIL there, too? Are we happy to relieve Assad?
<NAME/> <NAME/> Well indeed. Is that as far as we'll go? Or will we be trying to hit ISIS buildings in the urban area, too?
<NAME/> Incidentally, cracking speech from Alan Duncan
<NAME/> *having
<NAME/> <NAME/> With Damascus I gave an extreme example. Raqqa is perhaps more useful to debate. What's the plan there?
<NAME/> <NAME/> Alongside Assad? I might even agree with you. But that's not the debate anyone's happening.
<NAME/> <NAME/> That is a *completely* different conflict and I think it's reasonable to have reservations.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Not at all Marcus. Easy to be more specific than Syria. This motion lets us bomb the outskirts of Damascus.
<NAME/> <NAME/> ISIL v. Assad in some areas, ISIL v. YPG in others, ISIL v. random salafists v. FSA v. Assad v. Hezbollah in others
<NAME/> <NAME/> There are different fights across Syria. It matters for the HoC to know which it is joining...
<NAME/> <NAME/> There are tactical choices and strategic choices; I'm talking about the latter.
<NAME/> <NAME/> So would I. But we know that those judgments so often aren't listened to.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Where? For example, Syrian Kurdistan/Turkish border is a good plan. Deir al-Zour and Raqqa are trickier.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Where?
<NAME/> <NAME/> Nothing in external circumstances needs to change. We can start today. Just it'd be nice to know what the plan is.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Yes. But until there's more clarity on what we'll do, they could be good things or shortsighted things. <HASHTAG/> SyriaVote
<NAME/> ...and in the West it's unclear whether 'good' rebels, 'bad' rebels or Assad would fill the gap <HASHTAG/> SyriaVote
<NAME/> ...but the risk is in Western Syria where the more complex set of combatants means ISIL may just be one head of the hydra
<NAME/> Supporting allied ground forces with targeted air strikes is a good plan and we know from Iraq works...
Clear case for action but still unclear consequences. Need to know who we are targeting, where, and which power will fill the gap <HASHTAG/> SyriaVote

<NAME/> Difference of opinion among MPs I'm afraid. Big issue in the GE in Sunderland btw. I've had loads of emails.
<NAME/> I agree with your comments on fox hunting but it would be a free vote and I would vote to keep a ban.
The number of children in workless families is now at its lowest level since 1996 as Conservative welfare reforms continue to work.

<NAME/> Thanks James. I've had a look at this but can't find a reason why. I would certainly support a BSL translation.
<NAME/> I don't think either of them could survive in the council chamber in Sunderland!

Some tough questions for me at the <NAME/> debate but I'm pleased I turned up to put the Conservative view. Thanks for organising.

<NAME/> Many schools are saving money by cutting German teaching as it is no longer a top MFL. Any thoughts?
<NAME/> No.
<NAME/> I'm a school governor in Sunderland so I'll be okay thanks.
Education: In Wales Labour cut the budget and ditched England's reforms and standards plummeted.
<NAME/> Facts please.
Education: In Sunderland the Labour Council runs Children's Services and it was rated the worst in the whole country.

<NAME/> I am against fox hunting.
A busy day campaigning today. Leaflets in Pallion Ward followed by debate at Southmoor Academy and interview with <NAME/>
<NAME/> Yes, that's about all you'll achieve.
<NAME/> Labour's manifesto would hammer Sunderland, driving out business, reducing the local tax revenue and depopulating the city.
<NAME/> No they won't. The budgets will increase.
<NAME/> <NAME/> You mean 'of'. Says a lot about Labour in the North East.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Says a lot about Labour in the NE.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Spelling: 'you're'

The invitations are rolling in and I'm looking forward to the election debates in Sunderland. The Conservatives have a good story to tell.
<NAME/> Well done Ben-marvellous result.
<NAME/> Some Labour candidates are stating the bleeding opposite.
A vote for any Labour candidate is a vote for Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.
<NAME/> Thanks Lee.
<NAME/> Best wishes for your campaign Wendy and hope you and Dave are well.
<NAME/> Thanks Andrew.
Pleased to have been selected as the Conservative candidate for Sunderland Central and looking forward to the local debates.
<NAME/> <NAME/> Keep going. He has not answered the question <NAME/>
<NAME/> He called him a 'political basket-case'!
<NAME/> Don't worry. You'll find out on June 8th. :)
I can't see how Labour MPs can say that Corbyn is unfit to lead a party and then ask people to make him prime minister and lead a country.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> I'm thinking about it. The country requires strong leadership!
Enjoyed visit to <NAME/> Superb museums and lots of helpful volunteers. Shame City Hall and Guildhall not open to public.

A Labour councillor in Sunderland has been thrown off the council for failing to attend meetings.

<NAME/> Well done Stuart!
A benefits cap of Â£20,000 per household is equivalent to a salary of Â£25,000 which is above the average wage in Sunderland. Fair, surely?
<NAME/> <NAME/> If.
<NAME/> Very well done.
<NAME/> I'm enjoying reading his book. Hope you're settling in well.

<NAME/> Good article: We want Children's Services to improve in Sunderland but it's right to scrutinise the progress being made.
<NAME/> and journalist gets straight on the 'phone to local MPs for a reaction?
<NAME/> 'Gerrymander' has been well and truly misused today!
<NAME/> Spot on! Talk about piggybacking other people's success.
Disappointed that Sunderland Council isn't taking people fleeing from Syria. Newcastle and Gateshead are.
<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> Also in the Sunderland <NAME/> and very good too!
<NAME/> Did you say the same when Gordon Brown became PM?
<NAME/> Yeah, let's keep having referendums until we get the result we want and then stop!

Interesting claim in council report that Sunderland's economy has failed to regenerate due to a lack of immigration.

<NAME/> Probably just didn't want to let the Tories have a scalp. She's been a dead woman walking since the report.
<NAME/> I understand she has been nominated as chair of the Children's Services scrutiny panel. Is this appropriate?
<NAME/> Yes, I read it too but was too tired after the campaign to bother asking them to change it! Hope you're well.
<NAME/> Thanks-You and <NAME/> too!
<NAME/> Yes but he's no appeaser! Well done for getting so close in Hartlepool.

How can anyone complain about forced academisation in a local authority given the worst rating for Children's Services in the whole country?

<NAME/> OK just send me your name, address and telephone number please.
<NAME/> Sorry I don't debate with people who aren't brave enough to show their name and face.

<NAME/> Very well thanks!

<NAME/> Freedom to succeed, freedom to fail.

FOI request submitted re. 'golden handshake' pay off to Chief Executive in Sunderland who resigned after damning Children's Services report.
Sunderland Conservatives call for intervention after Chief Executive given secret payoff just weeks after damning Chidren's Services report.
<NAME/> Just less than the PM's salary would do.
I thought these council salaries higher than the PM's were to be reduced. <LINK/>
<NAME/> <NAME/> Labour councillors voted to keep CX's payoff from full council. Conservative councillor voted in favour.

<NAME/> No: 1,4  &  15 ok but others too generalised  &  I will consider issue by issue + as Tory candidate I support Tory manifesto.
<NAME/> i support some of it, yes

<NAME/> read your post carefully: calling me a toff is a personal comment. It reflects on you not me! Happy to debate issues
<NAME/> now don't be personal Neil. We don't know each other  &  this toff thing is tiresome. Voters want to hear debate not cheap abuse!
<NAME/> deficit halved, growth up, Welsh railways electrified, net incomes up, tax cut for 30m+. Lots more to do: vote Conservative
<NAME/> thanks  &  sorry for the delay in responding -I don't tweet very much  &  went through a few drafts: lawyers are always far too wordy!
<NAME/> 2/2 needed issue to be confronted in the next Parliament. As with most things mature reflection is the better approach to change
<NAME/> I don't know enough about it but am sceptical at there being an easy fix. We've tightened the system but tax reform is a much 1/2
<NAME/> deficit halved, tax cut for 30m, apprenticeships up  &  our long term economic plan will see further economic growth in Wales  &  UK.
